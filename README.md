## Developer Setup

These are the instructions to get the repository up and running locally.

### Install Required Prerequisites

#### nvm
nvm stands for Node Version Manager, and is the recommended way to manage Node versions locally. We'll use it to manage our Node install. Instructions on installing nvm can be found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

#### Node.js
Use nvm to install Node version 20.9.0:
```zsh
nvm install 20.9.0
```

#### Insall Node modules
```zsh
npm install
```

### Running the app locally
