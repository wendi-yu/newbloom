{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : VB9-06499 VB9-06500 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Azadeh Lankarani (Principal Respondent) and her son, Farhad Atash Lankarani (Minor Respondent), are citizens of Iran who made claims for refugee protection. The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness intervened at the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) hearing and argued that the Principal Respondent should be excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1(F)(b) of the Refugee Convention because there were serious reasons for considering that she committed a serious non-political crime outside Canada, namely, child abduction. The Minister argued, in the alternative, that she should be excluded pursuant to Article 1(F)(c) because, by virtue of taking her child away from his father, she was guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The RPD found that the Principal Respondent is not excluded, because she has a complete defence to the crime of child abduction in that her actions were necessary to protect the Minor Respondent from danger of imminent harm, and because removing a child from an abusively harmful environment is not contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The RPD found both Respondents to be Convention refugees. The RPD found that the Principal Respondent has a well-founded fear of persecution based on political opinion and religious belief because of her opposition to the dress code imposed on Iranian women by the state. The RPD found that the Minor Respondent, as a member of a particular social group, Iranian children, has a well-founded fear of persecution in the form of physical abuse by his father and stepmother and that he would not be able to obtain adequate state protection. The RPD found that neither Respondent has a viable internal flight alternative. The RPD\u2019s decision is being appealed to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) by the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (Minister). The Minister asks that the Principal Respondent be excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1(F)(b) and that the Minor Respondent be found not to be a Convention refugee or person in need of protection. In the alternative, if the RAD finds that the Minor Respondent faced imminent harm when he was taken from Iran, the Minister asks that the matter be referred to the RPD for redetermination with directions to consider whether state protection was sought for the Minor Respondent, and whether there is third party evidence that the Principal Respondent tried to obtain custody of him after the 2008 court order granting custody to his father. The Respondents argue that the RPD decision is correct, the appeal should be dismissed, and the RAD should confirm the decision of the RPD. The Respondents did not file a Notice of Intent to Respond, however, the Respondents\u2019 Record was filed on time. The time limit for filing the Notice and the Record is the same. The Respondents\u2019 intention to respond was clear from the filing of the Record, the Minister did not argue that there was any prejudice to his position resulting from the failure to file the Notice, and the documentation before the RAD is sufficient for the RAD to deal with the appeal. The information required by the Refugee Appeal Division Rules is part of the record, therefore, there is no reason to conclude that the Minister has been prejudiced by the omission of the Notice. DECISION The determinative issues in this appeal are, for the Principal Respondent, exclusion under Article 1(F)(b) and, for the Minor Respondent, state protection. I find that the RPD correctly decided that the Principal Respondent is not excluded from refugee protection and that state protection is not available to the Minor Respondent. I dismiss the appeal. BACKGROUND The Principal Respondent\u2019s claim and the issue of exclusion The Principal Respondent alleged that she has a well-founded fear of persecution based on political opinion and religious belief because of her opposition to the dress code imposed on Iranian women by the state. The RPD found that her claim was established. The Minister is challenging that finding only on the grounds that she should be excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1(F)(b). The Principal Respondent is divorced from the Minor Respondent\u2019s father. She alleges that he abused her physically during their marriage and she was able to leave him only by agreeing, when they divorced in 2008, to allow him to have custody of the Minor Respondent. She alleges that he did not respect her access rights and he severely limited her opportunities to see the Minor Respondent. She alleges that, knowing that the Minor Respondent was being abused by his father and stepmother, she decided to take him away from Iran in 2017. His father consented because she said that they were going to Canada for a vacation and would return. The Principal Respondent alleges that she had no way to protect her son from physical abuse other than by bringing him to Canada with her. Basis of the Minor Respondent\u2019s claim The Minor Respondent has lived with his father since he was born on Wednesday November 17 2004. The Minor Respondent alleges that his father has abused him physically for many years and that his current stepmother has also abused him physically. In 2017, when the Minor Respondent left Iran with his mother, he was living with his father and stepmother and his father had legal custody of him. He fears that he would be physically abused by them if he returned to Iran. Abuse of the Minor Respondent The evidence of physical abuse suffered by the Minor Respondent is relevant to the issues of exclusion and state protection so I have set out here the main findings made by the RPD. The RPD accepted the Minor Respondent\u2019s evidence that he has been subjected to continuous physical abuse by his father and, since his father\u2019s third marriage, also by his stepmother. The RPD found that the assaults, which \u201cleft him in pain, bruised, sometimes bleeding, and once scarred\u201d amount to persecution and a violation of his basic human rights. The RPD found that the use of force by the father and stepmother would not be considered reasonable under Canadian law, which allows the use of reasonable force to correct a child. The RPD accepted the evidence that much of the father\u2019s use of force is driven by his frustration or loss of temper, and that both the father and stepmother have used objects to assault the Minor Respondent and used force on him when he was a teenager. The father has slapped him in the face, and the stepmother has directed attacks at his head and frequently caused him to bleed because of her scratching. The RPD accepted the evidence that the Minor Respondent faced frequent assaults, often arbitrary, dependent on the father\u2019s mood, inflicted out of anger and frustration, and that he bears a permanent physical scar, and has been assaulted by his father while asleep in his room. The RPD found that the Minor Respondent has experienced abusive physical force by his father and stepmother frequently over several years. The RPD found that, on a balance of probabilities, the abuse would continue if the Minor Respondent returned to his father. The RPD found that the Principal Respondent knew that her son was being physically abused by his father and stepmother. She did not know exactly how often they abused him, but she knew that it happened often. She saw bruises on his body and knew that they had been caused by his father. NEW EVIDENCE The Minister has submitted as new evidence excerpts from The Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The Minister has the right to submit documentary evidence at any time before the RAD makes a decision. Therefore, I accept this evidence and consider it in my analysis. Neither the Minister nor the Respondents have requested an oral hearing. The new evidence does not meet the requirements for an oral hearing, as it is an extract from a document that states the law in Iran and does not raise a serious issue of credibility with regard to the Respondents. I will not hold a hearing. ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION My role is to look at all the evidence and independently determine whether the RPD made the correct decision. ANALYSIS The Minister has raised two issues on this appeal: Did the RPD err in finding that the Principal Respondent is not excluded under Article 1(F)(b) because she has a complete defence to the crime of child abduction based on danger of imminent harm to the Minor Respondent and the absence of a reasonable alternative to child abduction? Did the RPD err in finding that the Respondents had discharged their onus to show that adequate state protection is not available to the Minor Respondent? The RPD found the Respondents to be credible witnesses and this is not challenged on appeal. The RPD accepted that the Minor Respondent was abused, as alleged. Reviewing the record, I find that the RPD was correct. I see no reason to disturb those findings. The RPD correctly found that the Principal Respondent is not excluded by Article 1(F)(b) The RPD found that the Principal Respondent would be excluded if she did not have a defence to the crime of child abduction The RPD stated that, in considering whether the Principal Respondent had committed a serious non-political crime, the panel would consider what the result would be if a Canadian court were to apply Canadian criminal law to the facts in this matter. The RPD found that, but for any available legal defence, the Principal Respondent\u2019s conduct in bringing the Minor Respondent to Canada would constitute a serious non-political crime committed outside of Canada prior to coming to Canada. The Respondents did not argue otherwise. I accept this finding for the purposes of my analysis. The crime is that of child abduction, currently defined by subsection 283(1) of the Criminal Code as follows: 283 (1) Everyone who, being the parent, guardian or person having the lawful care or charge of a child under the age of 14 years, takes, entices away, conceals, detains, receives or harbours that child, whether or not there is an order referred to in subsection 282(1) [\u201ca custody order or a parenting order made by a court anywhere in Canada\u201d] in respect of the child, with intent to deprive a parent, guardian, or any other person who has the lawful care or charge of that child, of the possession of that child, is guilty of (a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years; or (b) an offence punishable on summary conviction. Subsection 283(1) was amended after the RPD rendered its decision, however, I find that the amendments have no bearing on the issues in this appeal. The RPD found that the Principal Respondent established that she has a full defence to the crime of child abduction, in that her actions were necessary to protect the Minor Respondent from danger of imminent harm. Therefore, pursuant to section 285 of the Criminal Code, she would not be guilty of an offence. The defence set out in section 285 is as follows: 285 No one shall be found guilty of an offence under sections 280 to 283 if the court is satisfied that the taking, enticing away, concealing, detaining, receiving or harbouring of any young person was necessary to protect the young person from danger of imminent harm or if the person charged with the offence was escaping from danger of imminent harm. The Minister argues that the RPD erred in finding that the Principal Respondent had a defence based on danger of \u201cimminent harm\u201d. The Respondents argue that the RPD\u2019s finding was correct. For the reasons that follow, I agree with the Respondents. The RPD correctly identified the elements of the defence The RPD identified the essential elements of the section 285 defence in these circumstances as being that the removal of the child was necessary, and that the removal of the child was to protect the child from danger of imminent harm. The RPD stated that, for the defence to succeed, three factors must be present: there must be a danger of imminent harm to the child; there must not be a reasonable legal alternative to taking the child; and the harm inflicted to the child in taking the child must be proportional to the potential harm to be avoided. The Minister does not challenge this analysis and I agree that it is correct. The first two factors are assessed on a \u201cmodified objective standard\u201d that takes into account the situation and characteristics of the person raising the defence. The Minister argues that the RPD erred in finding that there was sufficient evidence to establish that the first two factors were present. For the reasons that follow, I do not agree. The RPD applied the correct test for \u201cimminent harm\u201d In assessing whether the Minor Respondent was in danger of imminent harm, the RPD stated, to be \u201cimminent\u201d, the harm must be \u201cunavoidable and near\u201d, \u201cvirtually certain to occur\u201d and \u201cthe situation must be so dire that patience is unreasonable\u201d. The RPD recognized that, to be imminent, there must be a new instance of harm feared and that the defence in section 285 does not apply to acts intended to ameliorate effects of past harm. The Minister argues that there is no \u201cair of reality\u201d to the defence of imminent harm, that the Minor Respondent did not report an upswing in violence from his father or stepmother or any change in his circumstances in the immediate timeframe before his departure from Iran, and that his evidence was that the violence was sometimes frequent, sometimes less so, and made no mention of a rise in violence as a result of his planned departure for Canada. The Respondents argue that the Minister misconstrues the law on what constitutes \u201cimminent\u201d harm in the context of child abuse, child protection, and human rights. I agree with the Respondents. As the Respondents note, the RPD relied on relevant caselaw that discusses the meaning of imminent harm. I am not persuaded by the Minister\u2019s argument that, for the purposes of section 285, the test for whether harm is \u201cimminent\u201d requires evidence of a change in circumstances, such as an upswing in violence. I find that the RPD applied the correct test for determining whether the Minor Respondent faced a danger of \u201cimminent\u201d harm and there is no requirement that the anticipated harm be more severe or more frequent. The RPD found, after considering all of the evidence, that the harm feared was unavoidable and near. It was objectively reasonable for the Principal Respondent to believe that, if she did not take the Minor Respondent away at that time, he was almost certain to be physically abused before she would have any other opportunity to act. The Minister also argues that there is no evidence that the Minor Respondent\u2019s life was in immediate danger or that taking him away was necessary to protect him from danger of imminent harm, or that the Principal Respondent acted in response to an imminent or immediate danger. I am not persuaded by the Minister\u2019s argument. Section 285 does not require that the imminent harm be life-threatening nor does the Minister point to any basis for such argument. On the contrary, as stated by the RPD, the harm that is feared need not be different or worse than harm already experienced. Nor is there any requirement that there be a danger of immediate harm. The Respondents argue that the RPD correctly found that the Minor Respondent was in danger of harm that was unavoidable and near and therefore imminent. I agree. The Minister has not challenged the RPD\u2019s finding that the Minor Respondent suffered physical abuse from his father and stepmother for many years. Nor has the Minister challenged the RPD\u2019s finding that, on a balance of probabilities, the abuse would continue if the Minor Respondent returned to his father. The RPD found that the father and stepmother did not harm the Minor Respondent every day and that it was not virtually certain that he would have been harmed on the same day that he left Iran, had he stayed behind, or on the next day. The RPD found, however, that because of the Principal Respondent\u2019s limited and infrequent contact with her son, controlled by his father, taking him away on that day was her last opportunity to act and that waiting would have placed him in danger of imminent harm. The Respondents submit, and I agree, that the Minister\u2019s argument about whether harm is imminent is inconsistent with what the Supreme Court of Canada has said about the dynamics of abuse and the cycle of violence. The Minister\u2019s argument fails to take into account the realities of family violence and would unjustifiably restrict the availability of the section 285 defence. The RPD was correct to find that the Minor Respondent was in danger of imminent harm. The RPD did not err in relying on the Principal Respondent\u2019s testimony The Minister argues that the RPD erred in that the panel \u201csimply accepts the mother\u2019s testimony that she did not have regular access to her son and believed that she needed to act before her son was harmed again.\u201d I am not persuaded by this argument. The RPD found that the Principal Respondent was a credible witness. The Minister has not challenged the RPD\u2019s findings that the Minor Respondent was being abused. On a review of the record, I find no reason to question the credibility of the Principal Respondent\u2019s testimony regarding access to her son and her belief that she needed to act. On an independent assessment of the evidence, I agree with the RPD and accept the Principal Respondent\u2019s testimony. In finding that there was a danger of imminent harm, the RPD relied also on the Minor Respondent\u2019s testimony about the abuse and about visits with his mother. I agree with the RPD that he was a credible witness and this testimony also supports the conclusion that he faced a danger of imminent harm. The RPD correctly found that the Principal Respondent had no reasonable legal alternative The RPD found that the Principal Respondent had no reasonable legal alternative to taking the Minor Respondent away. The Minister argues that the RPD erred in basing this finding on the Principal Respondent\u2019s testimony in the absence of credible, third party evidence. The Respondents argue that this is wrong in law. The Minister also argues that the RPD erred in finding no reasonable legal alternative, in the absence of evidence that the Principal Respondent applied to an Iranian court for custody of the Minor Respondent. The Respondents argue that the RPD considered all the evidence and correctly decided that this was not a reasonable legal alternative. For the reasons that follow, I agree with the Respondents. When a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true. The presumption can be rebutted. The RPD found no valid reason to doubt the truthfulness of the Principal Respondent\u2019s testimony. Nor do I. The Principal Respondent testified that she could not apply for custody because she was able to obtain her divorce only by agreeing to give custody to her son\u2019s father. She testified that, shortly after the divorce, she kept asking him to give her custody, he refused, and she stopped asking after he remarried and told her that her son now had a mother and did not need her. She testified that in the two or three years before she left Iran, she asked him to give her custody or allow her to spend more time with her son, and he refused. The RPD also relied on the independent evidence of country conditions which is consistent with the Principal Respondent\u2019s testimony that she would have had no reasonable prospect of obtaining custody by applying to an Iranian court. The Respondents argue, and I agree, that the Federal Court decision on which the Minister relies is distinguishable in that it deals with claimants who were found not to be credible. The RPD considered the alternatives available to the Principal Respondent, having regard to the evidence that established, on a balance of probabilities, the following series of events: The Principal Respondent married the Minor Respondent\u2019s father when she was 19 years old and, four years later, on Wednesday November 17 2004, the Minor Respondent was born. During the marriage, the father was violent and abusive to the Principal Respondent. Over time, his violence towards her increased. The Principal Respondent and the father divorced in 2008. She had tried to get a divorce twice before but he had refused to sign the paperwork. One of his conditions for agreeing to the divorce was that he have custody of the Minor Respondent. She agreed because it was the only way for her to leave. When the Principal Respondent and the father divorced, they agreed that she would be able to see her son regularly. Shortly after the divorce, the father remarried. During the second marriage, the father allowed the Principal Respondent to see her son every 2 or 4 months, or 3 to 6 times a year. The second marriage lasted about two years. After the second divorce, the father married again. The Principal Respondent was then only allowed to see her son 2 or 4 times a year and did not see or speak to him for periods of up to half a year. The father and his third wife, the stepmother, were still together when the Respondents left Iran. The Minor Respondent\u2019s father controlled the Principal Respondent\u2019s access to her son. Although he had agreed, when they divorced, that she would be able to see her son regularly, he did not allow this to happen. The Principal Respondent tried to get the father to allow her more access to the Minor Respondent, as agreed, but was unsuccessful. She brought complaints to court in Iran, seeking more access, but was unsuccessful, and was told \u201coff the record\u201d by a judge, to work things out with the father. The Minister points to the fact that the Principal Respondent obtained a court order in 2008 confirming her right to access visits with the Minor Respondent for 48 hours each week and argues that she has failed to provide documentary evidence that she attempted to enforce this order. The Minister argues that, without such evidence, the RPD should not have accepted her testimony. I do not agree. The Principal Respondent testified that, despite the access order, the Minor Respondent\u2019s father controlled her access to her son. Her evidence was that she tried, unsuccessfully, to enforce the order through the police and by going to court and was told by a judge that she would not succeed and would have to resolve the matter with the Minor Respondent\u2019s father. I find this to be a reasonable explanation. It is unreasonable to expect that she be able to obtain documentation of what a judge said to her \u201coff the record.\u201d I have considered the independent documentary evidence, including the evidence filed by the Minister. The Civil Code of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Article 1174, states that the court will determine disputes between parents regarding the right of a parent to visit a child when they do not live in the same house. Article 1180 grants guardianship of a minor child to the father or paternal grandfather and Article 1248 provides that the court can order dismissal of a guardian in certain circumstances, including \u201coffences against children\u201d. The Respondents argue that there is a gap between the law in Iran, as it is written, and the manner in which it is applied, especially as it impacts Iranian women. Documentary evidence also indicates a high prevalence of child abuse in Iran, with physical punishment of children common and accepted. Article 1179 of the Civil Code gives parents the right to punish their children but not \u201cbeyond the limits of correction\u201d, those limits being undefined. Iranian law also grants the father of a child the right to kill the child, subject only to payment of blood money. Having considered the evidence in the National Documentation Package and the evidence submitted by the Respondents, I agree with the Respondents\u2019 argument and with the RPD\u2019s conclusion. Given that the Principal Respondent was unable to enforce the existing order for access, I find it speculative and unreasonable to suggest that she should have applied to the court for a custody order, particularly in light of the documentary evidence about the rights of women and children in Iran. On an independent assessment, I find that the RPD was correct to conclude that the Principal Respondent had no reasonable legal alternative for protecting her son from danger of imminent harm. The RPD correctly found that the evidence satisfied the test for proportionality The Minister has not argued that the RPD erred in its analysis of whether the harm inflicted to the Minor Respondent in taking him away from his father was proportional to the potential harm avoided. On an independent assessment, I find that the RPD correctly concluded, based on the evidence in the record, that the Minor Respondent would face greater harm as a result of continued physical abuse by his father and stepmother in Iran than the harm resulting from his removal from Iran. The RPD correctly found that the Principal Respondent established a defence under section 285 I find that the RPD was correct in concluding that the Principal Respondent has established that she has a complete defence under section 285 of the Criminal Code to the crime of child abduction. Consequently, I find that there is no serious reason to consider that she has committed a serious non-political crime before coming to Canada and, therefore, she is not excluded from refugee protection under Article 1(F)(b). The RPD correctly found that, on a balance of probabilities, state protection is not available to the Minor Respondent The RPD found that, on a balance of probabilities, the state of Iran would not provide adequate protection to the Minor Respondent. The Minister argues that the Respondents have not rebutted the presumption of state protection. For the reasons that follow, I am not persuaded by the Minister\u2019s argument and, on an independent assessment, I agree with the RPD. The Minister argues that, in the absence of evidence that state protection was sought by or on behalf of the Minor Respondent, the presumption of state protection has not been rebutted. The Federal Court decision on which the Minister relies does not establish that all claimants in all circumstances from all countries must exhaust all avenues for state protection. The Respondents argue, and I agree, that the requirement to approach the state arises only if protection might reasonably be forthcoming. The RPD reviewed the evidence, including the evidence of country conditions in Iran, and concluded that adequate state protection would not be available to the Minor Respondent. In reaching that conclusion, the evidence considered by the RPD included the following: Iranian law fails to define the \u201ccustomary and religious limits\u201d on the degree of force parents are permitted to use to punish their children. Parents, particularly fathers, have excessive legal rights, including the right of a father to kill their own child, subject only to the payment of diyyeh (blood money). Violence in the family is treated as a private, domestic matter to be resolved within the family. A review of case studies found that children in Iran experienced high levels of abuse, including physical abuse, and concluded that Iran\u2019s laws and policies did not adequately address the issue. Iranian authorities apply the death penalty to juvenile offenders and execute children. Authorities in Iran regularly commit human rights abuses with impunity. The Minister argues that these findings, in paras 98-102 of the RPD\u2019s reasons, are \u201cspeculative and/or not rationally connected to the evidence in this joint refugee claim\u201d. I am not persuaded by this argument. These paragraphs state the evidence to be found in independent documentation dealing with child abuse and human rights in Iran and provide citations for each reference. This is not speculation. It is evidence that is directly relevant to whether there is any reason to think that adequate state protection would be available to the Minor Respondent. I find that this is clear and convincing evidence that supports the RPD\u2019s conclusion that it would not be. On an independent assessment of the evidence, I agree with the RPD\u2019s conclusion. The Minister argues that there is insufficient analysis as to how the RPD could find that state protection was not available to the Minor Respondent and relies on a Federal Court decision that discusses the criteria for rebutting the presumption of state protection, including circumstances in which a claimant might not need to show that they have sought state protection. As I have already stated, the requirement to approach the state is not absolute. In particular, the requirement to approach the state exists only where protection might reasonably be forthcoming; there is no requirement to approach the state merely to demonstrate its ineffectiveness. I find that, in this case, the independent documentary evidence of failure to offer protection to other victims of child abuse clearly and convincingly indicates that it would be unreasonable to expect that the Minor Respondent should have approached the state for protection. I am reinforced in this conclusion by the fact that the Minor Respondent is a child. His claim for refugee protection is independent of the Principal Respondent\u2019s claim and I find it would be unreasonable to impose on him the same expectation that would apply to an adult in relation to seeking state protection. This is particularly so when he needs to be protected against abuse by his custodial parent on whom he is completely dependent. However, assuming that the Principal Respondent could have acted on his behalf, I come to the same conclusion. I find there is no adequate state protection for the Minor Respondent in Iran. CONCLUSION The RPD was correct to conclude that the Principal Respondent is not excluded from refugee protection under Article 1(F)(b) because the evidence establishes that she has a complete defence to the crime of child abduction. The Principal Respondent is a Convention refugee because she has a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran based on her political opinion and religious belief, in opposition to the dress code imposed on Iranian women. There is no state protection or internal flight alternative available to her because her persecutor is the state. The Minister did not challenge the RPD\u2019s findings in this regard. On independently reviewing the record, I find, for the same reasons given by the RPD, that I agree with the RPD\u2019s determination. On an independent review of the record, I agree with the RPD\u2019s assessment of the evidence and reasons for determining that the Minor Respondent has a well-founded fear of persecution in Iran, as a child who would be subjected to abuse by his father, who has legal custody of him, and his stepmother. For the reasons given above, I agree with the RPD\u2019s finding that there is no state protection available for him and, because he is a child, he does not have a viable internal flight alternative. Accordingly, I find that the Minor Respondent is a Convention refugee. The appeal is dismissed. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, I confirm the determination of the RPD that the Principal Respondent and the Minor Respondent are both Convention refugees.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Azadeh Lankarani', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 30, 'end': 32}, {'text': 'Farhad Atash Lankarani', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 40, 'end': 43}, {'text': 'Wednesday November 17', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 960, 'end': 963}, {'text': 'Wednesday November 17', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3814, 'end': 3817}, {'text': '2', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3956, 'end': 3957}, {'text': '4', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3958, 'end': 3959}, {'text': '3', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3962, 'end': 3963}, {'text': '6', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3964, 'end': 3965}, {'text': '2', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3998, 'end': 3999}, {'text': '4', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 4000, 'end': 4001}, {'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 5892, 'end': 5893}, {'text': 'Azadeh Lankarani', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 30, 'end': 32}, {'text': 'Farhad', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 40, 'end': 41}, {'text': 'Atash Lankarani', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 41, 'end': 43}, {'text': 'Wednesday November 17', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 960, 'end': 963}, {'text': 'Wednesday November 17', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 3814, 'end': 3817}, {'text': '4', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 3958, 'end': 3959}, {'text': '2', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3956, 'end': 3957}, {'text': '3', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3962, 'end': 3963}, {'text': '6', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3964, 'end': 3965}, {'text': '2', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3998, 'end': 3999}, {'text': '4', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 4000, 'end': 4001}]", "label": "dismissed"}
{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TC008985 TC008986 TC008987 TC008988 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW I dismiss these appeals. Chimamanda Owusu Ademola (the Principal Appellant or the PA), Omawunmi Ismail Ademola (the Associate Appellant or the AA), and Johnson Oyelude Ademola (the Minor Male Appellant #1 or the MMA #1) are citizens of Nigeria. Onome Matthew Ademola (the Minor Male Appellant #2 or the MMA #2) is a citizen of the United States of America (U.S.). The Appellants fear persecution and/or section 97 harm at the hands of leaders in the communities of the PA and the AA, who disapprove of the adult Appellants\u2019 interfaith marriage. The Appellants\u2019 allegations are contained in the Basis of Claim narratives of the adult Appellants and summarized in the reasons of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). The RPD rejected the Appellants\u2019 claims due to a general lack of credibility. The Appellants contend that the RPD erred by mischaracterizing their risk of harm, failing to consider the Gender Guideline when evaluating the AA\u2019s re-availment, misconstruing the delays in seeking safety both outside of Lagos and outside of Nigeria, and inadequately considering the traditional religious beliefs that dominate life in Nigeria. Furthermore, as it pertains to MMA #2, the Appellants assert that events arising in the U.S. after the RPD hearing confirm the ongoing risk of harm for Black males throughout America. The Appellants are seeking to admit new evidence and to hold an oral hearing. The determinative issue in this case is credibility. After reviewing the evidence, I find that the RPD did not err; the multiple significant inconsistencies gravely impugn the credibility and trustworthiness of the evidence. The Appellants did not provide reasonable explanations for these discrepancies. Furthermore, there was insufficient credible evidence to substantiate section 97 harm. Accordingly, the refugee claims were correctly rejected. DECISION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. NEW EVIDENCE The applicable law According to the law, I can only accept evidence that: arose after the RPD\u2019s decision; or was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision. If none of these criteria are satisfied, the inquiry ends there; the evidence cannot be admitted. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must then decide if the evidence is credible, relevant, and new. The evidence will not be considered if it lacks credibility as to its source and the circumstances in which it came into existence or if it is incapable of proving or disproving a relevant fact to the refugee claim. The evidence will also be excluded if it fails to prove a new fact, event, or circumstance arising after, or unknown at the time of, the RPD hearing. The Appellants bear the responsibility of making full and detailed submissions about how the proposed new evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and how that evidence relates to the claim. The evidence presented by the Appellants is rejected The Appellants have submitted the PA\u2019s written statement, dated August 10, 2020, in addition to several reports and articles concerning anti-Black discrimination in the United States (August 2018 - June 2020). The substantive content of the PA\u2019s statement arose prior to the RPD\u2019s decision. The document revisits questions that were asked at the RPD hearing involving, including biographical details and the nature of the agents of harm. I am mindful that an appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is not an opportunity to correct a deficient record. The Appellants have not adequately explained why the information contained in this statement was not reasonably available before the RPD\u2019s decision or why the Appellants could not be reasonably expected to have provided it to the RPD before that date. Therefore, the statutory test is not satisfied, and the statement is inadmissible. Both the PA\u2019s written statement and the media articles allude to the issue of police brutality against Black men in the U.S. The Appellants seek to present this evidence because the MMA #2 is an American citizen. I note that Counsel was asked at the RPD whether the Appellants are advancing a claim against the United States, to which Counsel responded in the negative. The Appellants argue that the Black Lives Matter movement arose after the RPD hearing. I find that the Appellants\u2019 submissions are without merit, and the submitted documents are entirely inadmissible. Though some of the documents are dated after the date of the RPD\u2019s decision, the substantive content relates to the disproportionate use of force against people of colour. This is a well-known, longstanding phenomenon predating by decades, if not centuries, the May 2020 death of George Floyd. An appeal to the RAD is not an opportunity to correct a deficient record. The Appellants had the opportunity to raise this issue at the RPD hearing but did not do so. Therefore, I conclude that the submitted documents did not arise after the RPD\u2019s decision, were reasonably available before the RPD\u2019s decision, and the Appellants could reasonably be expected to have provided them to the RPD before the RPD\u2019s decision. The statutory test is not satisfied. An oral hearing is not permitted As no new evidence has been admitted, I am not permitted to hold an oral hearing, pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA. ANALYSIS The role of the RAD The RAD reviews the RPD\u2019s decision and comes to an independent assessment of the refugee claim. In providing a final determination, the RAD will intervene if it finds that the RPD erred, unless the RPD\u2019s decision can be confirmed on another basis. The standard of correctness applies. If the RPD has a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral testimony, then the RPD\u2019s finding may be accorded deference. In this case, the RPD did not have a meaningful advantage, except with respect to its observations concerning an original news article submitted by the Appellants at the RPD hearing. Accordingly, I have conducted an independent assessment of the oral and documentary evidence almost exclusively using the correctness standard. The RPD did not err in assessing the Appellants\u2019 credibility At issue is whether the RPD wrongly evaluated the Appellants\u2019 credibility. I find that the RPD was correct; the quantity and seriousness of the Appellants\u2019 inconsistencies undermine their overall credibility. When directly asked whether he had been married to somebody other than the AA, the PA answered in the negative. However, the Appellants\u2019 U.S. permanent residence application reveals that approximately three months after his marriage ended with the AA, the PA married an American citizen. When confronted by this contradiction, the PA first explained that the Panel did not specifically ask whether the PA got married in the U.S. At the conclusion of the hearing, the PA added, \"The reason why I didn\u2019t talk about the lady in United States was that if I talk about it everything is -- I'm not going to get what I want -- I'm not going to -- I'm not going to get what I want here.\u201d The Appellants contend that the inconsistency is mitigated by the fact that the PA was forthright after being confronted with the evidence of his second marriage and that the PA brought proof to the RPD hearing of his divorce to his American spouse. These arguments are unpersuasive. Honesty and forthrightness are essential components of testimonial credibility. The tribunal must assess whether claimants are trustworthy sources of information. The PA\u2019s lack of candour is striking. It was not a mistake or oversight. As noted by the RPD, the Appellants\u2019 claims are grounded in the interfaith marriage between the PA and the AA. Evidence of a second marriage to another person, arising after the PA\u2019s union with the AA was dissolved in Nigeria and after the AA had returned to the U.S. to live with the PA, would obviously be highly relevant. Though it appears that the PA brought the American divorce certificate to the RPD hearing, this only further highlights that he anticipated that the issue would be addressed during the hearing. Asked why he did not adduce the divorce certificate before the hearing, the PA responded that he never thought that the events in the United States would be evaluated in Canadian proceedings. This explanation is unreasonable precisely because he brought the divorce certificate to the hearing and did not disclose it until after the contradiction was raised. Combined with the PA\u2019s awareness that the disclosure of his marriage in the U.S. could frustrate his desired outcome of the RPD proceedings, I find that there is overwhelming evidence that the PA intended to mislead the tribunal in this instance. The RPD did not err in making this finding. The Appellants\u2019 credibility was further impugned by their delay in leaving Lagos. The Appellants assert that the RPD erred by failing to consider that the Appellants relocated first to Jos and then to Port Harcourt in order to keep safe. However, the Appellants fail to appreciate the RPD\u2019s reasons. The RPD did not dispute that the Appellants relocated. Rather, it observed that in the period between the intrusion and threats at the Appellants\u2019 residence in January 2013 and the relocation to Jos in March 2014, the Appellants maintained the same residence in Lagos and were not subjected to section 96 or 97 harm. The fact that the Appellants merely waited for the PA\u2019s transfer is incompatible with the severity of the allegations. Prioritizing the PA\u2019s employment under those circumstances undermines the Appellants\u2019 credibility. Moreover, mere months later, the Appellants returned to Lagos in April 2015, the location where their problems allegedly originated. The Appellants claim that they had to leave Port Harcourt due to the kidnapping and the high cost of living. They decided to return to Lagos State in order to plan for their departure from Nigeria; they were most familiar with this region, which would facilitate their efforts to promptly obtain the requisite passports and visas. However, another lengthy delay ensued. The Appellants did not leave Nigeria until September 2016. They remained in Lagos during that time, at the same address where they resided previously. Delays are sometimes unavoidable, as persons seeking asylum often plan their escape and gather the resources necessary to secure essential travel documents. This case is altogether different. The decision to return to Lagos combined with the subsequent delay of approximately six months before leaving the country is incompatible with the severity of the Appellants\u2019 allegations and could not be reasonably explained. The Appellants failed to present sufficient credible evidence that they were required to return to Lagos in order to prepare for their departure or that they could only obtain the requisite travel documents in Lagos. Thus, the credibility of their allegations is further undermined. The re-availment of the AA and the MMA #1 to Nigeria in September 2016 is also inherently problematic. Persons genuinely fearing persecution and/or section 97 harm would not voluntarily return to the country of origin, absent a reasonable explanation. The AA explained that she did not fear being harmed at the time because the agents of harm were pursuing the PA and neither her nor the MMA #1. I am mindful that the refugee determination process requires an individualized assessment. I find that the AA\u2019s twelve-month return to Nigeria is incompatible with the severity of her allegations and undermines the Appellants\u2019 credibility. I reject the Appellants\u2019 argument that the AA only became aware of her personal jeopardy after returning to Nigeria and facing pressure to divorce the PA and to relinquish custody of the MMA #1 to the PA\u2019s relatives. Per the Appellants, the local chiefs\u2019 opposition to their marriage never waned. Furthermore, the AA asserts that she was personally frightened and traumatized after the break-in of June 2013, when intruders demanded that she leave the PA. Returning to Nigeria in light of these allegations could not be reasonably explained. I reject the Appellants\u2019 contention that the RPD minimized the risk of harm or failed to consider Counsel\u2019s written submissions. Simply because the RPD did not find in the Appellants\u2019 favour does not mean that the Appellants\u2019 submissions were ignored. Furthermore, the RPD is not bound, in its reasons, to reference every detail of a claimant\u2019s argument and evidence. Regardless, the RPD did appreciate the breadth of the Appellants\u2019 claims, including the alleged supernatural components resulting in perceived harassment from the agents of harm. I do not find that the RPD\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cdiabolic things\u201d with quotation marks implies a pejorative attitude towards the Appellants\u2019 traditional cultural beliefs. To the contrary, it emphasizes how the Appellants, in their own words, described their risk of harm. One of the reasons that the Appellants\u2019 credibility was impugned was precisely because the Appellants\u2019 behavior was inconsistent with a genuine fear of the supernatural abilities of the agents of harm. The RPD correctly assessed the police report regarding the 2017 attack of the Principal Appellant\u2019s brother and the news article related to the alleged 2019 attack of the PA\u2019s father. Both contained errors with respect to the dates which could not be reasonably explained. The police report refers to a date (June 2017) that is subsequent to the date that the report was stamped and issued (July 2017). Moreover, there were apparently conflicting dates on the newspaper\u2019s date of publication versus the date that the article was written. These discrepancies, on their own, would not necessarily warrant adverse inferences of credibility. However, combined with the findings mentioned above, they detract from the Appellants\u2019 overall credibility. Therefore, I find that not only do the Appellants lack credibility, but the Appellants adduced insufficient credible documentary evidence of a prospective risk of section 97 harm. The major credibility concerns are of such significance to place the veracity of all of the Appellants\u2019 evidence in doubt. In making my findings, I have specifically considered the Gender Guideline, recognizing the challenges faced by women in advancing credible and trustworthy refugee claims. Nevertheless, due to the seriousness of the credibility concerns involving both the oral and documentary evidence, and the lack of any allegations of gender-based violence, I maintain that the AA failed to credibly establish a forward-facing risk of section 96 or section 97 harm. The Minor Male Appellant #2 would not face section 96 or section 97 harm in the U.S. As mentioned in the New Evidence section, above, the Appellants are advancing new allegations on appeal with respect to the MMA #2, who is an American citizen. I have considered the Child Guideline because children may have difficulty expressing subjective fear. Reliance on objective documentation often becomes necessary to substantiate their claims. However, I find that, in this case, Counsel\u2019s arguments are without merit. Counsel submits that both the National Documentation Package (NDP) for the United States and current events confirm that Black males in the U.S. are \u201cat risk of harm and death by the operation of state actors including police as well as the school-to-prison-pipeline system in the United States for Black, African-American males.\u201d I reject this argument for two reasons. First, the United States, like Canada, is a well-established democracy with a robust security apparatus that generally protects its citizens. The United States is the world\u2019s most powerful nation state, featuring steady growth, low unemployment and inflation, and rapid advances in technology. It scores 86 out of 100 on the aggregate freedom score because of its broad protections of civil liberties. Second, the question is not whether the MMA #2 would face any harm on account of his race or ethnicity. Instead, the determinative question is whether this almost three-year-old minor Appellant would face a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk to life, cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and/or danger of torture in the United States. The objective country documentation simply does not support such a finding. To be clear, my reasons in no way minimize the tragic reality of systemic discrimination faced by Black, Indigenous, and people of colour, both in Canada and in the United States. However, as it relates specifically to the United States, the Appellants have failed to adduce sufficient credible evidence that the discrimination that the MMA #2 may face rises to the level of section 96 or section 97 harm.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : MC008954 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision Motifs et decision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Ibrahim Aruwa Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe (Appellant) is a citizen of Nigeria, and he is appealing a Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision that denied his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant alleges that he fled Nigeria because he fears his father, a devout Muslim Mohammed Usman Anjembe Akpali who was infuriated that the Appellant converted to Christianity and married a Christian woman. The RPD denied the Appellant\u2019s claim because it found that the Appellant had not established his identity, as required by section 106 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), and Rule 11 of the Refugee Protection Division Rules. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its assessment of several of the Appellant\u2019s identity documents. The RPD correctly decided that the Appellant had not established his identity, and therefore his claim must be dismissed. DECISION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. BACKGROUND The Appellant alleges that his real identity, the name under which he is claiming refugee protection, is Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala. The Appellant also alleges that when he decided to flee Nigeria, he was worried that his father could issue a lookout notice for the Appellant at the airport, and so he asked that the agent that was helping him secure a visa from the United States of America (USA), obtain a passport under an assumed name, which ended up being Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe. The Appellant went to the USA, and sought medical treatment there under the name of Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala. He asked his wife to send him identity documents under the name of Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe. Once he received those documents, he came to Canada, and claimed refugee protection under the name of Ibrahim Aruwa Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe The Appellant, attempting to establish his identity as Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala, submitted to the RPD a Birth Certificate, a Declaration of Age, a National Identification Number Slip (NINS), a Voter\u2019s Card, a Certificate of Origin, his Baptismal Certificate along with his Marriage Certificate, a School Certificate, and a copy of his alleged wife\u2019s passport. NEW EVIDENCE & Oral Hearing The Appellant presented evidence with this appeal, and requested an oral hearing. The evidence submitted by the Appellant does not constitute new evidence, and his request for an oral hearing is denied. The Appellant submitted copies of a Baptismal Certificate, a NINS, a Voter\u2019s Card, and a Certificate of Identification/Origin as proposed new evidence. These documents are not new. They were before the RPD, and they are contained in the RPD Record that is before me. The Appellant has also provided copies of two Federal Court decisions, which he argues support his submissions. Federal Court decisions are not evidence, but I have considered those decisions in my analysis. I reject the Appellant\u2019s request for an oral hearing. For the Refugee Appeal Division to hold an oral hearing, all the conditions set out in section 110(6) of the IRPA must be met, meaning that the new evidence: must raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Appellants; must be central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim. I have not admitted any new evidence, and therefore the requirements set out in section 110(6) of the IRPA to have an oral hearing have not been met. ANALYSIS As will be explained in detail in this decision, my reasons for concluding that the RPD decision is correct are as follows. The presumption at law that foreign documents are valid has fallen away in this case. This does not necessarily mean that the documents submitted by the Appellant are not valid. Instead, it just means that the Appellant cannot rely on the presumption that they are authentic, and that he must prove their authenticity. A second and related reason is that there are documents that are in different names, and the Appellant has not provided sufficient evidence to establish which of those documents are authentic and which are not. As a result, there is no basis to decide that the documents in the name of Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe are valid, over documents in the name of Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala. The Federal Court has indicated that there is a basic rule in Canadian law that foreign documents (whether they establish the identity or not of a claimant) purporting to be issued by a competent foreign public officer should be accepted as evidence of their content unless there is some valid reason to doubt their authenticity. The Federal Court has also stated that the presumption that foreign identity documents are valid falls away when there is valid reason for doubting their authenticity. The RPD explained why the presumption that the Appellant\u2019s foreign identity documents are valid falls away and why there are valid reasons for doubting their authenticity. I agree with the RPD\u2019s reasoning. The birth certificate submitted by the Appellant is of concern because the Appellant was unable to explain how his wife obtained it, and he was also unable to answer whether his birth was registered. It is not satisfactory that the Appellant was unable to name any documents that his wife submitted to obtain his birth certificate, when the objective country information indicates that there are documents that would have been required to be submitted. The Appellant\u2019s inability to answer whether his birth was registered or not is also not satisfactory. The objective country information for Nigeria indicates that if his birth had not been registered, the standard procedure would have been to issue an attestation letter, not a birth certificate. The RPD also correctly analyzed the birth certificate in light of the declaration of age document. I agree with the RPD that these two documents do not present a consistent story. As discussed above, a birth certificate is issued if a birth is registered. If a birth is not registered, an attestation letter is issued instead. In this case, the Appellant presented a birth certificate, which according to this background, would suggest his birth was registered. However, the declaration of age document specifically states, \u201cThat, at the time of his birth, his birth was not registered, but it was written in the family\u2019s record for that purpose.\u201d The Appellant testified at the RPD hearing that it is standard to indicate that the birth is not recorded, but I could not locate any objective country information to support this assertion. The concern about the birth certificate and declaration of age are sufficient to justify the conclusion that the presumption that the Appellant\u2019s identity documents are valid has fallen away. This means that the Appellant cannot rely on the presumption that his documents are valid, and instead has the onus to establish that they are valid. I agree that with the RPD\u2019s explanation for why the School Certificate, Marriage Certificate and a copy of Ms. Musa\u2019s passport are insufficient in establishing the Appellant\u2019s identity. The Marriage Certificate is not credible as it is not an official document, and there is a lack of evidence to support that it is authentic. While the pervasiveness of fraudulent documents does not necessarily mean a document is fraudulent, in this case, the presumption that the document is authentic has fallen away, and the Appellant has not provided sufficient proof to establish that this document is authentic. The School Certificate is not probative as it provides grades, or in other words, it is simply a report card. The excerpt from Ms. Musa\u2019s passport is not probative as it does not mention the Appellant\u2019s name or provide any particulars. On appeal, the Appellant specifically takes issue with the RPD\u2019s analysis of the Baptismal Certificate, the NINS, the Voter\u2019s Card, and the Certificate of Identification/Origin. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by giving no probative value to these documents without first making an explicit finding on their authenticity. The Appellant relies on a Federal Court decision that indicates that fact finders must have the courage to find facts, and they cannot mask authenticity findings by simply deeming evidence to be of little probative value. The Federal Court decision relied upon by the Appellant indicates that it is an error for a tribunal to not give a fair look at the evidence simply because the tribunal has first concluded that an applicant is not credible. The other Federal Court decision cited by the Appellant is the Oranye decision. In that decision, Justice Ahmed states that fact finders must have the courage to find facts, and that they cannot mask authenticity findings by simply deeming evidence to be of little probative value. Justice Norris of the Federal Court, citing the Oranye decision, has stated that, \u201cwhere a foreign public document is central to a claim and, if it is genuine, it would have high probative value, any doubts about its genuineness should be stated expressly rather than disguised as assessments of weight.\u201d Justice Mactavish of the Federal Court stated, \u201cDecisionmakers should not cast aspersions on the authenticity of a document, and then endeavour to hedge their bets by giving the document \u2018little weight\u2019.\u201d For the following reasons, I am not persuaded by the Appellant\u2019s arguments because I disagree with the Appellant\u2019s interpretation of how the RPD analyzed the documents in question, and I also disagree with his suggested interpretation of the Federal Court decisions he cites. I disagree with the Appellant\u2019s suggestion that the RPD erred in its analysis in the way these Federal Court decisions have cautioned against. When a tribunal gives low probative value or low weight to a document it does not necessarily follow that they are masking their doubts about the genuineness of the document, and I disagree that the RPD committed such an error in this case. I also disagree with the Appellant\u2019s argument that a finding of authenticity is always required. If a document is not probative, then it is unnecessary to consider whether it is authentic, or in other words, credible. Justice Grammond of the Federal Court defined the terms \u201ccredibility\u201d, \u201cprobative\u201d and \u201cweight of evidence\u201d thoroughly in the Magonza decision. Justice Grammond\u2019s discussion is instructive, and in summary, he indicates that \u201ccredibility\u201d means the worthiness of belief, or in other words, the answer to the question, \u201cis this a trustworthy source of information?\u201d He explains that \u201cprobative\u201d is the answer to the question, \u201cto what degree is this information useful in answering the question I have to address?\u201d The \u201cweight of evidence\u201d is, as Justice Grammond explains, a function of credibility and probative value or, if one likes to see this in the form of an equation, weight = (credibility) x (probative value). Justice Grammond explains that weight can only be assessed as a function of credibility and probative value. I will now turn to my specific analysis of the four documents that the Appellant alleges were analyzed incorrectly by the RPD. The Baptismal Certificate I find that that no weight should be given to this Baptismal Certificate in answering the question of the Appellant\u2019s identity. The document is inauthentic, and more importantly, there is no probative value. The Baptismal Certificate is in the name of Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala, and dated March 18, 1999. The Certificate is issued by \u201cGod\u2019s Revelation Holy Ghost Deliverance Ministry\u201d and is signed by the \u201cGeneral Overseer.\u201d The Baptismal Certificate does not contain a birth date, or the parent\u2019s name, which contrasts with the objective country information for Nigeria that indicates that such information should be included in Baptismal Certificates: In a telephone interview with the Research Directorate, a Catholic Priest in Nasarawa state indicated that baptism certificates contain a person's date of birth, along with other information such as their name and parent's names (Catholic Priest 22 Oct. 2013). The Catholic Priest said that baptism certificates are \"very often used as a birth certificate by the holders of these documents,\" as a lot of people do not register their births and do not have any certification of their births\" (ibid.). He said that the date of birth on a baptism certificate is often used as an official date of birth (ibid.). The Appellant argues that the RPD erred by indicating that the Baptismal Certificate does not have a seal of the issuing authority, and does not state the name of the issuing authority. The Appellant argues that there is a seal on the bottom left-hand side of the certificate, and that it states the name of the issuing authority as \u201cGeneral Overseer.\u201d I am not persuaded by these arguments because I find that a question of the sufficiency of the seal or whether \u201cGeneral Overseer\u201d is an issuing authority, is secondary to the very important fact that the certificate is missing a date of birth and the parent\u2019s names. As stated above, the objective country information indicates that a date of birth and the parent\u2019s names should be included in Baptismal Certificates. The fact that this basic and necessary information is missing in the Baptismal Certificate before me, overrides the issue of the sufficiency of a stamp or who signed the document. In other words, on a balance of probabilities, the absence of the basic and required information of the date of birth and parent\u2019s names makes this an inauthentic document. More importantly, this document has no probative value. The document contains the name of \u201cIbrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe,\u201d but there is no information in the document that links this document to the Appellant. For example, there is no birth date or parent\u2019s name, as discussed. The National Identification Number Slip I find that that no weight should be given to this slip in answering the question of the Appellant\u2019s identity, because there is no probative value to the document. The NINS is in the name of Ibrahim Aruwa Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe and contains an issue date of \u201cN/A.\u201d I find that the NINS has no probative value. A National Identity Card was not provided as evidence, and this slip in question is simply a receipt confirming that an application had been made. The objective country information for Nigeria indicates that, \u201cAfter completing the enrolment, a [t]ransaction ID [s]lip will be issued to the applicant as [evidence] of the transaction. However, the [t]ransaction slip does not confer the right to a [NIN]. The applicant will be requested to come back for the NIN within 2-7 working days, as it is subjected to availability of network, authentication and verification.\u201d There is a lack of evidence that the authentication and verification process ever took place after this receipt was issued, and the Appellant testified that he did not receive a National Identity Card. I find that the Appellant\u2019s testimony about how he obtained the slip does not increase the potential probative value of the document either. The Appellant testified that he did not submit any documents when he applied for his National Identity Number. The objective country information for Nigeria describes that an applicant must provide a bank verification number if they have one, as well as any of thirteen required original and valid supporting documents. The Voter\u2019s Card I find that more weight should not be given to this Voter\u2019s Card, versus other official documents containing a different name attributed to the Appellant. In other words, I have no basis to prefer this document over others. This Voter\u2019s Card is in the name of Ibrahim Aruwa Akpala, and contains a photograph, birth date and address. The Appellant testified that he did not submit any documents when he applied for this card, and he described the process as follows: That is how they do it. Like everybody that lives in that area, they ask you to line up in the primary school and they ask you to bring your, they take your thumbprint right there, they ask you your name and your address, and that\u2019s where they give it to you over there, because that\u2019s, if you are living in that area, that\u2019 what they ask for. No document, you just line up everyone, work done, they ask you to (inaudible) your address and your name and then they give you the card. The objective country information for Nigeria indicates that when applying for voter cards, eligible voters will have their textual data captured accurately, fingerprints scanned, picture taken and temporary voter identifications will be printed. The same country information further indicates that permanent voter cards, which one is eligible to receive if they have a temporary voter card, contain an embedded chip that contains biometric data of the holder, including fingerprints and a facial image. The same document indicates that according to Nigeria\u2019s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), temporary voter cards were \u201cfragile\u201d and \u201csusceptible to abuse\u201d for manipulating elections, and that: According to the EU Election Observation Mission report on the 2015 general elections in Nigeria, \"EU experts observed the [voter registration] process to be cumbersome, crowded, and marred by technical and staffing issues, with very few registrants presenting any documentation proving identity and age\" (EU July 2015, 16). The same source states that of the 11,464,690 new voters that INEC registered before the elections, the Commission removed 1,551,292 registrations that were either duplicates or did not meet biometric standards (ibid.). A 2015 report on the biometrics verification exercise conducted by INEC during 2011 and 2015 voter registration revealed cases of the same individuals registering to vote under different names (Nigeria 13 Jan. 2015). I find that the RPD\u2019s reasoning in paragraphs 93 to 97 of its decision is correct, and I agree with the analysis that the Voter\u2019s Card, based on fingerprints and a photograph, in the name of Ibrahim Aruwa Anjembe can be given no more weight than the passport under the name of Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala, also purporting to be a genuine document issued by Nigeria, and based on fingerprints and a photograph. As indicated by the RPD, \u201cThe Panel has no way of determining which one of them actually contains the real name of the claimant.\u201d In other words, faced with two documents, both issued by a government and both based on fingerprints and photographs, there is no basis for me to give one document containing one name more weight than another competing document with a different name. This is especially so when the reliability of voter\u2019s cards can be an issue, as indicated by the objective country information referred to above. The Certificate of Origin I find that no weight should be given to this Certificate of Origin in answering the question of the Appellant\u2019s identity because the document has no probative value. The Certificate of Origin is dated March 6, 2001, contains the Appellant\u2019s photograph, and indicates that \u201cIbrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala\u201d is an indigence/a native of Idumebo in Esan West Local Government Area of the Edo State, Nigeria. The Certificate of Origin is not useful in answering the question of the Appellant\u2019s identity. This is because the objective country information for Nigeria indicates that, \u201cin Nigeria, a place of origin speaks to the paternal ancestral place of birth of an individual and not the place of the birth of the individual.\u201d In other words, the certificate relates to someone else\u2019s birth, not the Appellant\u2019s birth. The same document indicates that certificates of origin have no legal basis, and that there are no established written criteria. CONCLUSION I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe (Appellant', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 25, 'end': 31}, {'text': 'Mohammed Usman Anjembe Akpali', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 74, 'end': 78}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 226, 'end': 229}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 296, 'end': 299}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 316, 'end': 319}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 333, 'end': 336}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 356, 'end': 360}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 369, 'end': 372}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 813, 'end': 816}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 825, 'end': 828}, {'text': 'Musa\u2019s', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1320, 'end': 1322}, {'text': 'Musa\u2019s', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1433, 'end': 1435}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 2139, 'end': 2142}, {'text': 'March 18', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 2145, 'end': 2147}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 2561, 'end': 2564}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 2642, 'end': 2646}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Akpala', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 2947, 'end': 2950}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Anjembe', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3390, 'end': 3393}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3406, 'end': 3409}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3585, 'end': 3588}, {'text': 'Idumebo', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3596, 'end': 3597}, {'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3738, 'end': 3739}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe (Appellant', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 25, 'end': 31}, {'text': 'Mohammed Usman Anjembe Akpali', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 74, 'end': 78}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 226, 'end': 229}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 296, 'end': 299}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 316, 'end': 319}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 333, 'end': 336}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 356, 'end': 360}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 369, 'end': 372}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 813, 'end': 816}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 825, 'end': 828}, {'text': 'Musa', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 1320, 'end': 1321}, {'text': 'Musa', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 1433, 'end': 1434}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 2139, 'end': 2142}, {'text': 'March 18', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 2145, 'end': 2147}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 2561, 'end': 2564}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Oluwamuyiwa Anjembe', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 2642, 'end': 2646}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Akpala', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 2947, 'end': 2950}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Aruwa Anjembe', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 3390, 'end': 3393}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 3406, 'end': 3409}, {'text': 'Ibrahim Oluwamuyiwa Akpala', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 3585, 'end': 3588}, {'text': 'Idumebo', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3596, 'end': 3597}]", "label": "accepted"}
{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TB708107 TB708108 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Redetermination of Appeal Nouvel examen de l\u2019appel Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW This is the redetermination decision allowing the appeal of Selim Ozan Pehlivan, (the \u201cson Appellant\u201d), but dismissing the appeal of his father, Mazhar Pehlivan (the \u201cfather Appellant\u201d). The Appellants are citizens of Turkey. They allege they have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of their political opinion, as well as on the basis of their ethnicity and faith as Alevi Kurds. The son Appellant also fears imprisonment for conscientious objection and for evading military service. They appeal a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying their claims for refugee protection. The RPD found: the Appellants were lacking in credibility about their allegations of political activities and their detentions; their profiles as non-politically active Alevi Kurds did not place them at risk in Turkey; and, the son Appellant failed to establish he is a conscientious objector to military service. As a preliminary issue, the Appellants submit new evidence and request an oral hearing. On the merits, the Appellants argue: they were denied procedural fairness due to their former counsel\u2019s actions or omissions; the RPD erred in its credibility assessment; they face discrimination amounting to persecution; and, the RPD failed to assess the son Appellant\u2019s risk under section 97 for failing to perform military service. I find the son Appellant is a Convention refugee, but find the father Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. In coming to this conclusion, I have accepted most of the Appellants\u2019 new evidence, but I deny their request for an oral hearing. With respect to both appeals, I find there is no breach of procedural fairness due to the conduct of former counsel. However, in regard to the son Appellant\u2019s alleged political opinion and Facebook postings sur place, I find this is determinative of his appeal and establishes he faces a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey. In regard to the father Appellant\u2019s appeal, I find he is not credible in his allegations, his profile as a non-politically active Alevi Kurd does not face a risk upon return to Turkey, and he does not face a forward-looking risk as a family member of the son Appellant. DECISION The appeal of Selim Ozan Pehlivan is allowed. I substitute my own decision that he is a Convention refugee. The appeal of Mazhar Pehlivan is dismissed. The RPD was correct in finding that he is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND The RPD Decision The Appellants had a refugee determination hearing on February 2, 2017. In a written decision issued on April 6, 2017, the RPD rejected the claims. First Appeal to the RAD The Appellants appealed to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). By a decision dated October 19, 2017 (the first RAD decision), the RAD rejected the appeals. Judicial Review By a judgement dated November 16, 2018, the Federal Court granted the Appellants\u2019 judicial review and remitted the matter to the RAD for redetermination of the appeal. The Federal Court found the first RAD appeal confused the identities of the Appellants, and failed to conduct an assessment under section 97 with respect to prison conditions, as it was a fear expressed by the son Appellant for evading military service. I note that the Federal Court did not address the Appellants\u2019 argument that the first RAD appeal failed to consider the allegations of incompetent former counsel. Redetermination Notice and Opportunity to Provide Additional Submissions On December 13, 2018, the RAD Registry gave the Appellants 30 days to submit to the RAD any objections to the material to be included in the appeal record, and to provide any additional submissions to the RAD in response to the Federal Court\u2019s decision. No objections or submissions were received by the RAD within 30 days of the Registrar\u2019s notice. However, the Appellants provided documents and submissions after the 30-day notice period elapsed. As a result, and in accordance with the practice of the RAD in redetermination appeals, the documents and submissions provided after the 30-day notice period were accompanied by a Rule 29 application. This is because the 30-day period becomes the de facto date of perfection and when the appeal record is considered due. Any documents or submissions not previously provided with that appeal record must seek permission from the RAD to use the document or submission in the form of a Rule 29 application. If that Rule 29 application is allowed, the documents are then assessed for admissibility under subsection 110(4). Furthermore, in redetermination appeals any new documents submitted prior to the first RAD decision, and within the 30 days of the RAD Registry\u2019s notice, are treated as evidence submitted with the appeal record. These documents are assessed for admissibility only under subsection 110(4). This is the case even if at the time of the first RAD decision the documents were initially submitted as a Rule 29 application. Given numerous documents and submissions were received in this appeal, including many documents submitted prior to the first RAD decision, as well as after the Federal Court\u2019s decision, the above is provided for context. I hope this context assists in clarifying a confusing appeal record. ADMISSIBILITY OF NEW EVIDENCE ON APPEAL Evidence submitted with the Appellants\u2019 record I can only accept new evidence that: (1) arose after the rejection of the claim by the RPD; or (2) was not reasonably available; or (3) was reasonably available, but the claimant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented the evidence, at the time of the rejection. If one of these conditions is met, I must decide if the evidence is credible, relevant, and new. Evidence concerning allegations against former counsel Letter from Current Counsel to Former Counsel, dated 27 April 2017; Response from Former Counsel to Current Counsel, dated 26 May 2017; Legal Aid Certificate Information Page, dated 6 June 2017; Affidavit of the Interpreter Regarding Translation Timeline, dated 5 June 2017; Translations of Facebook postings submitted to the RPD, undated; The Appellants do not indicate that the letter from current counsel to former counsel, or former counsel\u2019s response to current counsel\u2019s letter, are being submitted for the purposes of new evidence. Nor do the Appellants provide any submissions on the admissibility of these two documents. Nevertheless, given the Appellants raise the competence of their former counsel as an issue at the RAD, I have assessed these documents as if they were intended to be submitted as new evidence. However, I find it problematic that I am unaided by the Appellants in the assessment of these documents, as they are required to provide submissions on how the documents meet the requirements for admissibility. I accept the Appellants\u2019 documents listed as 1) and 2) relating to their allegation that they were denied procedural fairness due to former counsel\u2019s incompetence or negligence. These two documents could not have been provided until after the RPD rejected the Appellants\u2019 claims. This is because their allegation of counsel incompetence, due to former counsel failing to translate documents submitted to the RPD, is a new issue. In particular, I note that the Appellants would likely have been unaware that the son Appellant\u2019s Facebook posts were not translated until they received the RPD\u2019s decision. Furthermore, it was upon obtaining new counsel for their appeal that they were able to write to former counsel and put their concerns to him in order to receive his response. Therefore, I find documents 1) and 2) meet the criteria under subsection 110(4). I also find documents 1) and 2) are new, relevant and credible. They are new, as no similar evidence appears in the record. They are relevant to the Appellants\u2019 allegation that they were denied procedural fairness at the RPD on account of their former counsel\u2019s conduct. The documents are also credible as they include documents from credible sources, including former and current counsel. Therefore, documents 1) and 2) are admissible as new evidence. With respect to documents 3) and 4), these documents were submitted in order to explain why the Facebook posts that were previously submitted to the RPD untranslated, could not be translated and submitted to the RAD in their first appeal with the appeal record. Since all documents submitted for the first RAD decision are now considered to be submitted with the appeal record, these documents are not relevant in the redetermination of this appeal. Finally, with respect to document 5), the assessment of admissibility depends on my findings below in regards to whether there was a breach of procedural fairness due to former counsel\u2019s incompetence. In my analysis below, I find that former counsel failed to have the son Appellant\u2019s Facebook posts translated, which fell below what one would expect of counsel. As a result of former counsel not meeting his performance requirements, the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstance to have presented the translated Facebook posts prior to the RPD\u2019s decision. Therefore, the requirements of 110(4) are met. I also find these documents are new as there are no similar Facebook posts already in the record. They are relevant to the son Appellant\u2019s political identity, as some of the postings refer to Alevis, the president, prime minister, and politics in Turkey. Finally, they appear credible in their source and circumstance, as the RPD questioned whether the son Appellant had social media postings, and he said he did. Also, the copies provided show that the comments and posts shared by the son Appellant appear to be from his own Facebook account. Therefore, I find document 5), the translated Facebook posts, are admissible as new evidence. Evidence submitted pursuant to a Rule 29 application Rule 29 allows the Appellants to make an application to provide a document not previously provided. Such an application must include an explanation of how the document meets the requirements of section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and how that evidence relates to the Appellant. In determining the application, the RAD must consider any relevant factors, including: the relevance and probative value of the document, any new evidence the document brings to the appeal, and whether the Appellants could have, with reasonable effort, provided the document with the appeal record. In this case, that would be prior to the 30-day notice period elapsing. If the document complies with Rule 29, it is not immediately admissible as new evidence. The document must still meet the admissibility criteria for evidence submitted with the appeal record, which is described above. In this appeal, the Appellants have submitted three Rule 29 applications. I have grouped and assessed these documents for admissibility based on issue and when they were submitted. Rule 29 and additional documents concerning allegations against former counsel Complaint to the Law Society of Ontario (LSO), dated 29 April 2019; Complaint Acknowledgement Letter from the LSO, dated 6 May 2019; Decision Letter from the LSO, dated 8 May 2019; Email from the Son Appellant and Additional Submissions on Counsel Incompetence, dated 15 November 2019; The Appellants fail to explain why their complaint to the Oh could not have been provided earlier, especially considering they were notified to provide documents to the RAD in support of their appeal redetermination within 30 days. While the Appellants submit that they made this LSO complaint because the first RAD decision rejected the admissibility of their evidence due to the lack of a complaint to the LSO, this does not explain the delay of more than four months in making the complaint to the LSO. Moreover, I note that the LSO\u2019s response to the Appellants\u2019 complaint was not submitted to the RAD for nearly six months after the LSO informed the Appellants of its decision not to investigate the complaint. The Appellants have not adequately explained why the LSO complaint could not have been made within the 30 days described in the RAD Registry\u2019s letter. Nevertheless, I will allow their Rule 29 application and accept the LSO complaint as new evidence. I accept that these documents could not reasonably have been provided earlier for two reasons. First, since the first RAD appeal, the Immigration and Refugee Board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) has issued a \u201cPractice Notice \u2013 Allegations against Former Counsel.\u201d This Practice Notice includes a protocol to be followed when such allegations are made. One aspect of the protocol informs Appellants to disclose to the Board complaints they have made to law societies against former counsel. Since the Appellants have made such a complaint to the LSO, albeit quite late in the process, I will not reject it on the basis of a technical rule, especially given the Board\u2019s policy requires they disclose the complaint to the RAD once made. Second, it is clear that the first RAD decision found the lack of a complaint to the law society to be a factor in rejecting their allegations of incompetence. As a result of the first RAD decision, I can hardly blame the Appellants for now making a complaint in order to cover their bases upon the redetermination of their appeal. On this point, I highlight that the new Practice Notice does not require complaints to the law society be made in order to make out allegations against former counsel. I also find these Rule 29 applications are relevant and probative to the Appellants\u2019 allegations of procedural fairness due to incompetent counsel. For these reasons, I accept the Appellants\u2019 Rule 29 applications regarding their LSO complaint documents, as well as counsel\u2019s additional submissions with respect to the LSO\u2019s decision in their complaint. In regards to the admissibility of the documents submitted. I find documents 6) to 8) are admissible as new evidence under subsection 110(4), as these documents could not reasonably have been expected to be presented at the time of rejection. The documents are a result of following a procedure that was not in force at the time of the RPD\u2019s rejection of their claim, and it was in response to comments made in their first RAD decision. The documents are new as they appear nowhere else in the record, they are relevant to the issue of whether the Appellants were denied procedural fairness on account of their former counsel, and the documents credibly demonstrate that a complaint has been made against their former counsel for review to the LSO. Moreover, the letters and decision are from the LSO, which is considered a credible organization. Therefore, I find the criteria for the admissibility of new evidence is satisfied and documents 6) to 8) are admissible as new evidence in this appeal. Rule 29 applications and documents concerning the Appellants\u2019 allegations Affidavit of the Son Appellant, dated 23 April 2019; Photos of the Appellants at Demonstrations in Canada, dated 16 March 2019; Letter from the Son Appellant\u2019s Mother and Residential Registration Documents, dated 10 March 2019; Letter from the Mother\u2019s Lawyer, dated 5 March 2019; Letter and WhatsApp Message from the Son Appellant\u2019s Friend, received 23 March 2019; Facebook Postings, dated 20 December 2018 and 28 December 2018; Concert Tickets, dated 20 September 2018; and, Additional Memorandum, dated 25 April 2019. The Appellants submit that they could not have provided these documents earlier due to delays in receiving legal aid, and then delays in having their documents translated. However, in his affidavit, the son Appellant states that he met with current counsel and the interpreter on March 6, 2019. He does not explain or provide any evidence to demonstrate that he made reasonable efforts to apply for legal aid at the earliest opportunity. Such information would be helpful in order to assess whether to accept this Rule 29 application. In any case, I will take counsel at his word that such delays were not in the control of the Appellants, and therefore, they could not have, with reasonable effort, submitted this Rule 29 application prior to the end of the 30-day notice period. For the purposes of this appeal, I am willing to allow the Rule 29 application and accept that the documents provided upon appeal are both relevant and probative to issues related to the son Appellant\u2019s political opinion and that these considerations outweigh any concerns I may have as to whether some of these documents could have been provided earlier. Turning to the admissibility of the documents under subsection 110(4), I accept documents 10) to 15) as new evidence. These documents are new because these documents post date the RPD\u2019s decision and bring to the appeal information about events that have occurred since their claim was rejected by the RPD. As a result, documents 10) to 15) could not have been provided to the RPD prior to its decision. In regards to the jurisprudential criteria, the documents are also relevant to the issue of the Appellants\u2019 alleged political activities and purported political opinion, as well as the son Appellant\u2019s risk upon returning to Turkey. With respect to the credibility of these documents, on their face they appear to be credible in their source and circumstances. The documents include: a sworn affidavit from the son Appellant about demonstrations he has attended, Facebook postings he has made that appear to be from his account, a letter from his mother with identification, a stamped letter from his mother\u2019s lawyer about his mother having to move residences, and a letter from a friend sent via WhatsApp with identification. Therefore, I find the requirements for admissibility are satisfied, and documents 10) to 15) are admissible as new evidence. However, I find the concert tickets listed as document 16), are inadmissible as new evidence owing to lack of relevance. The Appellants do not explain how these concert tickets are relevant to their appeal or why they should be admitted as new evidence. Even if the Appellants attended a concert where a Kurdish singer performed, it is not clear how these assist them in establishing their claims or advance issues in this appeal. Without clear submissions, or an explanation for their inclusion, I can only assume these are submitted for the purposes of establishing the Appellants\u2019 Kurdish identities, which are not in dispute. For this reason, I reject document 16) and find the concert tickets are inadmissible as new evidence due to lack of relevance to the issues in this appeal. Rule 29 and country condition documentation United States Department of State, Turkey Country Report, dated March 2019; Freedom House, Freedom on the Net 2018, dated 2018; Human Rights Watch, Turkey \u2013 Crackdown on Social Media Posts, dated 27 March 2018; Council of Europe, Memorandum on Freedom of Expression and Media Freedom in Turkey, dated 15 February 2017; The Appellants submit that the country conditions evidence being provided is from a more recent National Documentation Package (NDP). They submit this evidence specifically addresses social media issues and shows that the situation in Turkey has worsened since the RPD rejected their claims. The Appellants provide no further submissions on why their Rule 29 application should be allowed or on the admissibility of these documents under subsection 110(4). Nevertheless, I am willing to accept that all the documents provided in the application are both relevant and probative to the conditions in Turkey since the rejection of their RPD claim. Since I am to consider the most recent NDP in the adjudication of the appeal, the relevance and probative value of these documents outweigh any concerns I may have as to whether they could have been provided earlier. Although the Council of Europe report is dated prior to the rejection of their claim by the RPD, I will admit documents 18) to 21) as new evidence. These documents are new insofar as they are contained in the NDP that was not available at the time the RPD rejected their claims. Also, these reports are relevant to the issue of the son Appellant\u2019s social media posts, his alleged political opinion, and whether he has a forward-looking risk based on sur place social media comments. The documents are also credible, as they are from reputable sources and the documents contained in the NDP are monitored for quality assurance. Therefore, I find the objective country conditions meets the requirement for the admissibility of new evidence, so I admit documents 18) to 21) as new evidence. In sum, I find documents 1-2, 5-15, and 18-21, admissible as new evidence. The RAD denies the request for an oral hearing The RAD may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is new evidence that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal, is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim, and, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. The Appellants provide few submissions on why an oral hearing should be held in this appeal. They simply argue that an oral hearing should be held in relation to the son Appellant\u2019s affidavit, dated April 23, 2019 and the letter from his mother, if there are any credibility concerns. I find that an oral hearing is not warranted in this case. Although I have credibility concerns with the mother\u2019s letter, they are not determinative of the son Appellant\u2019s claim. In any case, I am able to substitute in favour of the son Appellant notwithstanding those credibility concerns with the letter. The mother\u2019s letter, the documents related to the allegations against former counsel, and the country conditions evidence about social media do not raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the father Appellant to warrant holding a hearing. Also, the one photograph of the father Appellant at a demonstration in Toronto is not determinative of his appeal. I am also able to assess these documents based on their content and in light of the totality of the evidence in the record and without holding a hearing. Therefore, I deny the request for an oral hearing. ANALYSIS I have assessed whether the RPD\u2019s decision is correct. Was there a breach of procedural fairness due to counsel\u2019s incompetence or negligence? The Appellants\u2019 Arguments The Appellants argue their former counsel failed to effectively represent them at the RPD. They claim their former counsel submitted untranslated Facebook posts with photos of the son Appellant at demonstrations in Turkey and Toronto, which they argue shows content of a political nature. They argue that had the Facebook posts been translated, the RPD may have accepted the son Appellant\u2019s evidence that he is a conscientious objector. The Appellants also argue in their memorandum that their former counsel\u2019s incompetence is further demonstrated by his written submissions to the RPD, where former counsel \u201creferred to a medical report and that the RPD accepted the diagnosis, but according to the recording there was no medical report filed. This must have a typo.\u201d In their additional submissions on counsel incompetence, the Appellants further argue that their former counsel misunderstood what the RPD member had requested for post-hearing submissions. They claim that they provided the posts to their former counsel because they knew the RPD requested the information. In addition, the Appellants submit that their former counsel erroneously believed the Facebook postings were irrelevant, even though he was responsible for making reasonable attempts to seek out crucial information. The RPD had flagged the importance of social media posts that would have been of a political nature, which were provided to former counsel and submitted to the RPD untranslated. In regards to the LSO\u2019s decision to reject the complaint against the Appellants\u2019 former counsel, the Appellants argue that I should ignore the LSO\u2019s decision. They submit I should determine whether their former counsel was negligent because the LSO missed the point of their complaint and believed the Appellants were seeking damages. The RAD\u2019s Assessment I accept the Appellants\u2019 argument in part. In my view, the Appellants have not established the stringent test for establishing their former counsel was incompetent, and therefore, they were not denied procedural fairness. However, there is evidence to show that former counsel\u2019s performance fell short of what one would expect from counsel. As a result of former counsel\u2019s performance, I accept as new evidence the son Appellant\u2019s Facebook posts that were previously submitted to the RPD untranslated. Although I find the Appellants\u2019 former counsel did not meet the performance component of the test, there was no prejudice to them, or miscarriage of justice amounting to a denial of procedural fairness. My reasons follow. The Test for Counsel Incompetence Incompetence or negligence of counsel will amount to a breach of procedural fairness in only limited circumstances where: (a) the incompetence is sufficiently specific and clearly supported by evidence [the performance component]; and (b) there is a fairly arguable case that the result would have been different [the prejudice component]. Where counsel incompetence or negligence is alleged, the courts have required a complaint to the governing body as a form of corroborating evidence of the allegations. While complaints to a regulatory body may serve to corroborate claims of incompetence, they should not be perceived as requirements to making such an allegation. It is required that former counsel be given notice and an opportunity to respond to the allegations made against him. With respect to former counsel\u2019s conduct, the Supreme Court has stated, \u201c[t]he analysis proceeds upon a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. The onus is on the appellant to establish the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment. The wisdom of hindsight has no place in this assessment.\u201d The Performance Component I find that there is evidence to support the Appellants\u2019 submission that their former counsel did not meet the performance component. First, I agree with the Appellants that the LSO\u2019s decision to dismiss their complaint misapprehends their complaint. The LSO\u2019s decision focuses on whether or not the Appellants suffered financial losses as a result of their former counsel\u2019s conduct. This is not what they alleged. In addition, the LSO\u2019s decision provides no analysis of the Appellants\u2019 complaint that their former counsel did not translate evidence he submitted to the RPD, and in this context, there is no consideration of the role of counsel or how this is important in refugee determination proceedings. This is unfortunate, as the LSO\u2019s own tribunal has noted the professional responsibilities of counsel in refugee determination cases. In any case, I am not bound by the assessment made by the LSO. The assessment I am to make is whether the Appellants have established the threshold for a breach of natural justice, which is different than the assessment the LSO is statutorily mandated to determine for professional misconduct. Moreover, as the Board\u2019s recent policy on allegations of counsel incompetence indicates, there is no requirement that a complaint of counsel incompetence be made to the LSO in order for such an argument to be assessed at the RAD. Second, although the Appellants do not provide an affidavit in this appeal to provide specifics about their allegation and the steps they took, there is sufficient evidence that former counsel did not meet his performance requirement regarding the untranslated Facebook posts. In particular, regardless of whether the RPD specifically asked for the son Appellant\u2019s Facebook postings to be submitted after the hearing, his political opinion and identity was an issue before the RPD. Former counsel himself acknowledged this in his reply to current counsel that he informed the son Appellant that his political identity was an issue. As such, former counsel knew that any evidence to support his political opinion could assist his claim. Also, even if the RPD did not specifically ask for his Facebook postings as post-hearing disclosure, the RPD did ask about whether there were any and there was nothing preventing former counsel from making an application for their inclusion post-hearing. Moreover, based on the evidence in the record, former counsel\u2019s response to current counsel about the complaint suggests to me he is not being forthright in his defense. For example, it is nonsensical to me that former counsel says in his reply that the son Appellant \u201cdid not provide me with any post-hearing notice or information that he had discovered his political Facebook posting\u201d. This is simply not believable as the Appellants\u2019 former counsel in fact submitted to the RPD as post-hearing disclosure, the son Appellant\u2019s untranslated Facebook postings. One of counsel\u2019s responsibilities is to help the Appellants \u201cmarshall the necessary evidence\u201d to support their claim. This includes assisting the Appellants in having their documents translated, which former counsel did with the Appellants\u2019 other documents. Therefore, I find the Appellants\u2019 former counsel\u2019s failure to have the son Appellant\u2019s Facebook postings translated, shows that his performance fell short of what one would expect. The Prejudice / Miscarriage of Justice Component The Appellants argue that had their former counsel properly disclosed translations of the Facebook posts to the RPD, the outcome of the son Appellant\u2019s refugee claim would have been different because the posts show he is a conscientious objector. I do not accept this submission. The Appellants \u201cmust show substantial prejudice to the individual and that prejudice must flow from the actions or inaction of the incompetent counsel. It must be shown that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would be different.\u201d The son Appellant has failed to explain how these Facebook posts alone show he is a conscientious objector or that his claim would have been accepted based on the content of these postings. In this regard, I note that the son Appellant provides no affidavit about these Facebook postings in particular, and how the outcome would be different. Furthermore, as a result of former counsel\u2019s failure to meet the performance component of the test, I have admitted the Facebook posts as new evidence. It now forms part of the record before me, which I am able to independently assess and weigh the Facebook postings in light of the totality of the evidence. In effect, I am in the same position as the RPD would have been had it obtained the translations as post-hearing evidence. In addition, as discussed below, those Facebook posts alone would not change the outcome, it was these posts, along with later posts and new country conditions evidence submitted in this appeal that changed the outcome. Moreover, I note that these Facebook posts relate only to the son Appellant\u2019s political opinion claim, which I have substituted in his favour in this appeal, the son\u2019s Facebook posts do not change any evidence related to the father Appellant\u2019s allegations or his evidence presented to the RPD. Therefore, I find the Appellants have not satisfied their burden that they experienced a miscarriage of justice due to the Facebook posts not being translated at the RPD. The Appellants also made additional allegations against former counsel. In their memorandum they allege former counsel referred to irrelevant information in his post-hearing written submissions. In their LSO complaint, the Appellants further allege their former counsel did not prepare for their case because he said he was too busy, ignored their case file, did not read the notice of decision, told them they lost the case because of themselves, and said he did not believe they were real Alevi Kurds. I find the Appellants have not met their burden of establishing that these issues prejudiced them or resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The allegations are not sufficiently specific and clearly supported by evidence. I note again that the threshold is a high one. In regard to the irrelevant paragraph in former counsel\u2019s submissions to the RPD, this did not factor into the RPD\u2019s decision. It appears to be the result of former counsel using a prior case as a template in the completion of written submissions. In addition, based on my review of the record and the audio recording, there is nothing to suggest that this paragraph is indicative of former counsel not having a general understanding of the case to be met, the Appellants\u2019 claim, or understanding the evidence in the record. I find this typographical error in former counsel\u2019s written submissions is a minor mistake that does not detract from the effectiveness of his representation, and since the RPD did not rely on former counsel\u2019s irrelevant submission, there was no prejudice to the Appellants. With respect to the other allegations in the LSO complaint I find these allegations are insufficiently specific and not clearly supported by the record. The allegations are too general and vague. While some of these allegations indicate that their former counsel may have been unpleasant to them, this does not demonstrate that he was incompetent in representing them, or that this prejudiced them. Furthermore, based on my review of the record, including the audio recording of the hearing, their former counsel appeared prepared to represent them at the RPD. Evidence was submitted to the RPD, former counsel asked the Appellants questions and clarified the evidence, interjected when necessary, asked to provide post-hearing evidence to assist the Appellants\u2019 claims, and provided thorough written submissions advocating for the Appellants. There is nothing in the record before me to demonstrate that their former counsel was unprepared for the hearing. Beyond the isolated incident of failing to translate a few Facebook posts for the son Appellant, former counsel appears to have competently represented the Appellants. The Appellants have not explained how they were prejudiced as a result of these allegations made to the LSO. In considering the cumulative effect of the alleged deficiencies, I find the Appellants have failed to demonstrate the prejudice component of the incompetent representation test. Therefore, I am not convinced this case involves the type of exceptional circumstances that warrant a finding of incompetency on the part of former counsel, which warrants a determination of a breach of natural justice. I reject the Appellants\u2019 procedural fairness argument. The RAD accepts the son Appellant\u2019s claim based on his social media postings critical of the Turkish government The RPD\u2019s Findings The RPD found the son Appellant lacking in credibility about his detentions in Turkey. This is because the son Appellant said he decided to leave Turkey after his 30-hour detention on May 12, 2015. He testified that in order to leave Turkey he applied to go to school in Canada, a process that took about a week and a half to complete. However, the RPD pointed out that his acceptance letter was dated June 4, 2015, which undermines the credibility of his allegation that he was detained and that it was the impetus for him to leave Turkey. The Appellants\u2019 Argument The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in the assessment of the son\u2019s credibility. They submit that the RPD found a discrepancy where one did not exist. The RPD assumed that the acceptance letter was communicated on the date of the letter, there was nothing implausible that it took a week and half to be informed that he had been accepted. The Appellants also argue that the son Appellant\u2019s Facebook postings demonstrate his political opinion and place him at risk from the government if he returns to Turkey. They submit that the Facebook evidence shows he has engaged in political arguments with non-friends on social media, and the son states in his affidavit that although his personal posts are only viewed by friends, shared posts can be seen by non-friends. They submit that the objective evidence provided as new evidence shows that since 2016, the Turkish government has checked thousands of posts and even innocuous posts have resulted in detentions, which carries the possibility of torture. The RAD\u2019s Assessment I reject the Appellants\u2019 arguments concerning the RPD\u2019s credibility assessment of the son Appellant\u2019s allegations. The RPD did not err. If indeed the Appellant received the acceptance letter a week and a half after it is dated, this should have been his explanation to the RPD. The RAD is not the Appellants\u2019 opportunity to repair a defective record before the RPD, especially through counsel\u2019s submissions and not with evidence. I find the RPD was correct in its assessment for the same reasons as those provided by the RPD. The son Appellant\u2019s evidence is inconsistent about whether his travel was related to his political activities and detention. The timeline of his testimony is inconsistent with his documents and leads me to conclude that he was not detained in May 2015 on a balance of probabilities. However, I find the Appellants\u2019 argument concerning the son Appellant\u2019s sur place Facebook postings has merit, which is determinative of the son Appellant\u2019s claim. The son\u2019s Facebook postings exhibit a political opinion, and when these posts are considered with the fact that some posts were shared, the objective evidence shows the government has targeted opponents through social media. In light of this, and considering the son Appellant is a university student, a photographer/artist, as well as an Alevi Kurd, I find he faces a serious possibility of persecution if he returned to Turkey due to his political opinion and social media postings. Specifically, several of the son\u2019s Facebook posts demonstrate a political opinion critical of the Turkish government and President Erdogan. In particular, the son states in one post that \u201cFrom the president, to the minister, and the members of the parliament all are licking and smarmy.\u201d He also posted criticism on a shared article about a prize given by the President to an artist in Turkey. In another post, the son Appellant shared a post that was critical of the current economic situation in Turkey, comparing the state of the economy from 2002, prior to President Erdogan coming to power, and 2017. In a shared post about the Halklar\u0131n Demokratik Partisi (HDP), the son Appellant engaged in a debate with a non-friend, where he was critical of the Justice and Development Party (AKP), and calling an opponent of the HDP a fascist and racist against the Kurdish. It is inferred from the content of the son Appellant\u2019s comment that the other person was espousing a nationalist and sympathetic view of AKP policy and making racist comments to the son Appellant. The son Appellant explains in his affidavit that such shared posts are able to be viewed publicly. I am satisfied that these posts exhibit a political opinion of the son Appellant, and that he has established such postings could come to the attention of Turkish authorities, thereby placing him at risk upon returning to Turkey. The documentary evidence shows that individuals have been prosecuted for posts deemed to insult President Erdogan, an offence punishable by up to 4 years in prison. The documentary evidence also shows that \u201cfollowing a steep drop in the value of the lira, the government promised sanctions against \u201c\u2018disturbing\u2019 comments or social media posts about the economy, effectively criminalizing criticism of the government's handling of the economy and the crisis.\u201d In general, the documentary evidence demonstrates that the government is targeting individuals who post on social media sites, and take a broad view of any comments made against the government as terrorist. The government monitors social media and \u201cstudents, artists, association members, including 11 senior members of the Turkish Medical Association faced criminal investigations for alleged terror-related activities, primarily due to social media posts.\u201d Moreover, the Interior Ministry reported that authorities investigated 631,233 digital materials, monitored 110,000 social media publications and detained 7,000 individuals. Other figures from the Ministry state that security forces initiated investigations on 50,000 social media accounts for sharing what they deemed \u201cterrorist\u201d content, with 20,000 legal actions taken. Between 2016 and April 2018, authorities investigated more than 45,000 social media accounts and took legal action against 17,000 on charges of propagandizing for and praising a terror organization. Between January 20 to February 26, 2018 there have been 648 people detained for posts critical of Turkey\u2019s military operations in Syria, and 197 detained for expressing solidarity with protestors. The evidence also shows that persons have been imprisoned for sharing, reposting, or retweeting content on social media. Overall, the recent crackdown on social media has targeted a wide range of people, journalists, human rights activists, politicians, members of pro-Kurdish HDP, members of NGOs, academics, construction workers, physicians and high school and university students. Given the son Appellant\u2019s postings above demonstrating a political opinion against the current government in Turkey, as well as his status as a university student, having photographed HDP rallies, and his recognized Alevi Kurd identity, I find he faces a serious possibility of persecution on the basis of his political opinion if he returned to Turkey. Since the government is the agent of harm, there is no state protection or internal flight alternative available to him. For the above reasons, I find that despite credibility concerns with the son Appellant\u2019s core allegations, I find he is a Convention refugee and I grant his appeal. The RAD finds the father Appellant does not face a risk on the basis of family membership The Appellants\u2019 Argument The Appellants submit that if I find one of the Appellants merits protection, I must consider the risk to the other Appellant as a family member of a person who may be persecuted for reasons of political opinion, in addition to any other elements of the claim. The RAD\u2019s Assessment I agree that I must consider this, however, the Appellants\u2019 submissions are completely unhelpful in this regard. Aside from arguing I must consider it, they provide no submissions about how, based on the evidence, the father Appellant warrants protection simply because he is a family member of the son Appellant. They point to no evidence, and based on my review of the record I cannot find any to support it. The Appellants cannot just raise an issue or a concern and expect the RAD to find evidence that the fear claimed would likely occur. I have no obligation to do the Appellants\u2019 work of looking for such evidence for them. That said, I have reviewed the documentary evidence, and while the National Documentation Package (NDP) mentions that family-members of suspected Gulenists may face difficulties in Turkey after the failed coup attempt, this is not the Appellants\u2019 circumstances. They are not Gulenists, nor were they involved in the failed coup attempt. I can find no persuasive evidence that family members face a risk of persecution in Turkey on account of a family member espousing a political opinion against the government, and more specifically, on social media. The mother and lawyer\u2019s letter I note that the son Appellant submitted a letter from his mother and her lawyer indicating she was being harassed by police who were continually coming to her home looking for him. I find this letter deserves no weight to establishing that family members of the son Appellant face a risk in Turkey. I have several concerns with the letter submitted by the son Appellant. First, with respect to its probative value, the document says nothing about why police came to the mother\u2019s home. Based on the content of the letter they could have come for any reason, including unrelated to his refugee claim. In any case, I would expect that had the police come to the mother\u2019s home for any reason related to his alleged detentions, political opinion, or his Alevi Kurdish identity, this would have been mentioned in the letter. Second, the letter states that police came to the mother\u2019s home \u201cmany times\u201d since the son Appellant left Turkey. However, I do not find this credible. The Appellant was specifically asked at his RPD hearing, which was held approximately one and a half years after he fled Turkey, whether his mother had any difficulties in the city (Istanbul) where she lived. The son Appellant testified that she did not, and only faced little problems in \u201cbusiness\u201d. When asked what problems she faces, he said she faced problems with respect to listening to Kurdish music. Third, the son Appellant testified that his mother only lived at the address in Istanbul during the summer months, so the fact that she moved during the summer months from Istanbul in December 2018 because police came looking for the son Appellant is lacking in credibility. His mother would not reside there during the winter months anyway. Fourth, the fact that she now lives with her brother does not prevent the police from visiting her if they were legitimately looking for the son Appellant, or if he was of interest to the authorities. There is no evidence that since this letter was written she has faced any problems in Turkey. Fifth, I note that the son Appellant also provides a letter from his mother\u2019s lawyer. However, I cannot give this letter any weight either. It simply repeats information relayed by the mother herself, which is found lacking in probative value and credibility. The lawyer has no firsthand knowledge of the events. Therefore, I reject both the letters from the son Appellant\u2019s mother and her lawyer. Given their lack of probative value and credibility I give them no weight. Finally, I observe that since the Appellants left Turkey, there is no evidence that the police have come looking for the father Appellant, including at his home in Amed, where he lived with his mother prior to leaving Turkey. Based on the above, I find the Appellants have not established that the father Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Turkey due to being a family member of the son Appellant. The RAD finds the father Appellant\u2019s claim is not credible The RPD\u2019s Findings The RPD found the father Appellant lacking in credibility about his allegations. The father was unable to clearly explain what he meant when he wrote in his Basis of Claim (BOC) form that he \u201cbecame politically active\u201d. In addition, the father presented a letter from the local HDP office, but he was unable to explain who he called in order to get this letter. In addition, he did not know the name of the person who signed the letter, and the letter states he was involved with that local HDP during a time he was not living in that location. Finally, the RPD found the father Appellant lacking in credibility about a key event, his alleged incarceration after joining an HDP election rally in February 2015. The RPD noted that the father did not know the name of the local candidate for that election, did not know the date of that election, and did not know the result of the election. The Appellants\u2019 Argument The Appellants argue that it was unreasonable for the RPD to find that the father could not describe what \u201cpolitically active\u201d meant. They submit the father is inarticulate, so when he answered that he supported the HDP, there was nothing incredible about his response. The Appellants contend the father only has 3 years of education and he was clearly under pressure at the hearing. They claim the father\u2019s political opinion was genuine and unsophisticated. The Appellants further argue the RAD should accept the HDP letter for what it says, which is that the father supported the HDP from January 2014, and that he previously supported the Democracy Party of Turkey and North Kurdistan (TKDP) from June 2010 to July 2014. With respect to the HDP rally he attended, they submit he was a simple supporter and clearly not informed as to the purpose of the rally beyond it being a rally that the HDP was attending. The Appellants argue the RAD should take a different view of the evidence because the father is unsophisticated about his political support. The RAD\u2019s Assessment I reject the Appellants\u2019 argument and find the RPD did not err. I do not accept the Appellants\u2019 argument that because the father only has 3 years of education and is unsophisticated, this explains his difficulty in expressing his political activities. The father Appellant was able to provide great level of detail in his BOC narrative, also despite only having several years of education he was able to travel on his own internationally over the years, obtain visas to these countries, and maintain employment in Turkey. Even though the father Appellant does not have a lot of education this does not mean he is unable to answer basic questions about his claim in a straightforward and coherent manner. Furthermore, there is no medical evidence before me to indicate he suffers from any psychological or medical condition that could explain his trouble in testifying before the RPD. The RAD finds the father could not credibly explain his political activities At the hearing, the RPD asked the father why he stated he feared arrest and violence if he returned to Turkey. In response, he stated the it was because of his Kurdish ethnicity and Alevi faith. When the RPD noted that he mentioned political activities in his BOC, and asked why he did not mention this as the basis of his fear, he said he \u201ccould not understand right now\u201d. I do not accept this explanation because the father understood the question in order to state that he feared returning on account of his Kurdish and Alevi faith. Later in the hearing, the father commented that when the son Appellant was taken into custody in May 2015, he returned to Turkey and \u201cbecame active politically\u201d. The RPD asked what he meant by politically active. In response, the father simply repeated that he \u201cbecame politically active\u201d, by saying he was a supporter of HDP. However, I note he allegedly joined the HDP before his son was taken into custody. The father also said he was \u201cthinking\u201d that the rights of Kurdish and Alevi people are being violated in Turkey and because of this he \u201cbecame politically active. The RPD asked again what politically active means, and he said election marches and campaigns of the HDP, May Day celebrations, joining them and providing support to them. The RPD confirmed that his support and attendance at these events occurred after his son\u2019s second detention, and he said yes. However, the RPD asked if he was politically active before this, and he said no, but he was supporting. The RPD asked how he was supporting, and he repeated that he joined party marches, election meetings, march events, and joined them and support them. As a result of this response, the RPD said it was confused as to what changed if he was attending events before his son\u2019s detention too. The father did not respond to the question, saying his son\u2019s second detention made him active against the Turkish state and police. The RPD repeated that it was confused as to whether anything changed in his political activity, and he said when he was a HDP, prior to the son\u2019s detentions, he was not permitted or wanted to be part of any association or organization. However, this is inconsistent with his refugee application documents stating he was a member of HDP and TKDP prior to 2015 when his son was allegedly detained. Moreover, the father was internally inconsistent in his response by saying he was supporting passively then, when previously in his testimony he said he was joining marches and election meetings prior to his son\u2019s alleged detention. His testimony continued to evolve to say after his son\u2019s two detentions he was more active politically against the state and police, because he was on the frontline with banners and posters, joining marches and demonstrations, showing support. Based on the above, I find the father Appellant was unable to explain what he meant by \u201cbecame politically active\u201d. In addition, in his testimony he was inconsistent with his other evidence about his political involvement, and his testimony evolved. Therefore, the RPD\u2019s assessment is correct and I find he was unable to clearly and easily describe his own political activities and motivations. The RAD finds the father\u2019s HDP letter is not likely genuine I also reject the Appellants\u2019 argument regarding the RPD\u2019s treatment of the father\u2019s HDP letter. I have reviewed the letter for what it does say, however, since the father is unable to credibly testify about how he obtained the letter, who signed the letter, and where he was when he joined the party, his lack of knowledge undermines the credibility of its contents. I agree with the RPD that the father was unable to say who he called to get this letter, he did not know the name of the person who signed the letter, and the letter stated he was involved with the local HDP since January 2014, when he was not living in the location of the branch that issued the letter. I find his explanations for his lack of knowledge are not acceptable. When asked why he did not know who signed the letter, his testimony was evolving. First, he said he did not remember at the moment. The RPD asked if he was so involved in the HDP he could not remember the chairperson\u2019s name, the father then stated it was because he did not deal with the chairpersons, he dealt with friends, and he was a member of the HDP, and it was \u201cimpossible for him to remember\u201d. The RPD also pointed out that he previously testified that he lived at the hotel, which is not in Istanbul, XXXX May 2014 to April 2014, so asked why the HDP letter would say he joined and supported the HDP in May when he was not there in May 2014. The father\u2019s response was nonsensical and did not explain why it said he joined the branch in an area he was not living in, stating the letter was worded that way because the chairman changed and there was an election in May, and Kurdish friends and HDP affiliates know him and witnessed him. Given the father\u2019s inability to coherently testify about who he contacted to obtain the letter, who signed the letter and who the chairman of the branch was when he was allegedly a supporter, and why the letter says he joined and was a supporter during a time he did not live in Istanbul, I find on a balance of probabilities that the HDP letter is not genuine. The father\u2019s alleged detention in January 2015 I reject the Appellant\u2019s argument that I should simply view the evidence differently than the RPD, without identifying an error in its analysis. I have reviewed the record, and find the RPD\u2019s assessment is correct. The father alleged that he was involved and active in election marches to support the HDP, including on January 12, 2015. However, he did not know his local HDP candidate during the election, did not know the election results, and did not know the date of the election. I would expect that if the father was as politically active and involved in the HDP as he alleges, he would be able to testify to basic information about his party\u2019s participation in the election, when the election was held, and the purpose of the rally if he was a genuine supporter of the HDP. Based on the above findings, I agree with the RPD that the father Appellant was not politically active as alleged. Since his alleged detentions and fears are due to his not credible political activity, he has failed to provide credible evidence to support that he is at risk in Turkey on the basis of his actual or imputed political opinion. The photos of the father Appellant attending protests in Canada do not overcome the above credibility concerns I have reviewed the new evidence, as well as the other photographs in the record showing the father Appellant attending protests. The Appellants make no argument in regards to these photographs and the father\u2019s refugee claim. Having reviewed the photos, I find they deserve little weight and are insufficient to overcome the above credibility concerns with the father Appellant\u2019s claim. In particular, I note that the photographs taken are all of his attendance at protests in Canada, and there is no such photographic evidence in relation to the many protests and activities he alleges to have participated in Turkey. In my view, the father\u2019s attendance at these protests is simply submitted in order to bolster his claim, and are not demonstrative of a genuine political opinion. The father also provides no information about the protests, such as an affidavit about his attendance at these protests, how he learned about them, who could attend, and what he is protesting. Finally, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that his attendance at these demonstrations has come to the attention of Turkish authorities, such that he faces a risk in Turkey going forward. For these reasons, I find on a balance of probabilities that the father simply attended the protests in Canada to bolster his refugee claim. The father Appellant does not face a forward-looking risk as an Alevi Kurd With respect to the Kurdish population, country conditions articles include reports of discrimination, including the use of abusive language against the Kurds by parliamentarians and that some Kurdish groups do \u201cexperience problems exercising the freedoms of assembly and association.\u201d Some reports indicate that steps have been taken towards mitigating tensions, in which: official censure or harassment of Kurds who publicly spoke Kurdish or asserted their ethnic identity decreased markedly. In both law and practice, the government took steps toward accepting the Kurdish language in private education, the judiciary, state-owned media, and public services. \u2026 ... [R]allies in cities nationwide freely celebrated the Kurdish new year holiday of Newroz. The documentation further states that hate rhetoric by some of the Turkish media has been reported, as having incidents of societal violence. However, it also states the numbers of such incidents are relatively small compared to the size of the Kurdish population in Turkey and that, when taken cumulatively, the discrimination faced by Kurds does not amount to persecution within the terms of the Refugee Convention or otherwise inhuman or degrading treatment. It is true that the country conditions documents substantiate that Alevis are discriminated against in Turkey, as they are not recognized as a distinct religious group, their houses of worship (or cemevis) are not recognized, and Alevi students are not able to be exempted from Sunni religious classes in school. Also, because the Turkish government does not consider cemevis to be legal places of worship, they cannot receive legal and financial benefits associated with such status. Such benefits include tax exemptions, reimbursed electrical charges, and recognition of Alevi leaders. Alevis have also experienced difficulties establishing new places of worship. This unequal treatment has been recognized by the European Court of Human Rights as discriminatory against Alevis. However, the Alevis are free to practice their religion. Regardless, out of approximately 80 million Turkish inhabitants, approximately 20 million are Alevi. While some sources indicated that Alevis regularly face societal discrimination, others indicate Sunni Muslims and Alevis generally co-exist with relatively few problems. While isolated incidents of violence against Alevis are identified in the country conditions documents on file, the bulk of the evidence on this point is well summarized by statements in the United Kingdom Home Office report on Alevis in Turkey that such incidents \u201care few and most Alevis co-exist with other communities with few problems on a daily basis\u201d and that \u201c[e]ven when taken cumulatively, the treatment faced by Alevis does not in general amount to them being subject to action on the part of either non-state actors or the authorities which would amount to persecution or serious harm.\u201d I agree that the situation facing Kurds and Kurdish Alevi in Turkey since the attempted coup in July 2016, and the subsequent declaration of a state of emergency, is creating challenges. The rule of law in Turkey has seriously eroded and pro-Kurdish and other opposition voices in Turkey have faced a crackdown. The Kurdish population in Turkey disproportionately suffers from the effects of the state of emergency. Many Kurdish and Alevi print media and television channels have been banned. Intolerance against Kurds generally has increased in Turkey over the past two years. There have been reported incidents and threats of violence in Alevi neighbourhoods in Malatya and Antakya, and harassment of Alevis in certain districts in Istanbul. However, it is reported that police prevented attacks in Alevi neighborhoods. There is also concerning evidence that many individuals, including Gulenists, journalists, academics, teachers, doctors, judges, police, pro-Kurdish and Alevi politicians, party members and supporters have been arbitrarily detained and mistreated. However, the documentation shows that certain profiles of persons may be at risk of persecution in Turkey today, this includes some Kurds and Alevis, primarily politicians, journalists, community leaders, political protestors and activists. The father Appellant does not fit any of these profiles. The father Appellant is not in a leadership position, nor is he credible in his political activities and involvement. I see little evidence that suggests that regular Kurds and Kurdish Alevi are singled out for mistreatment in Turkey today. Rather, it is those who are politically and socially active who appear to be most at risk. Regular Kurds and Alevis have almost certainly witnessed increased insecurity and infringements on their rights of social engagement and access to Kurdish and Alevi services and media. However, these circumstances do not normally rise to the level of persecution. The evidence does not lead me to conclude that average Kurds and Alevis routinely face arbitrary detention, mistreatment and torture, nor do they face discrimination that rises to the level of persecution. The Appellants argue that I should consider all the relevant elements of the claim from a cumulative perspective. However, as the RPD correctly pointed out, the father Appellant\u2019s allegations of some difficulties related to his ethnicity in the past were not so significant that he sought to seek protection outside Turkey. There are many instances where he travelled to countries in Europe and Canada on previous occasions. The Appellants do not contest this finding. Considering they do not contest it, I see no reason to interfere with it, it is correct and based on the evidence in the record. The father Appellant has lived in Western Turkey for more than 40 years, where he lived and worked, moved around freely, was able to travel and return, and attended religious events as he wished. Also, I note that the other incidents relied on by the father Appellant occurred over 15 and 35 years ago respectively, they were neither persistent or repeated. The father Appellant\u2019s profile is that of a regular Alevi Kurd. He did not credibly establish a risk profile as a politically active individual. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the father\u2019s profile is such that he would be unlikely to attract the attention of Turkish authorities were he to return to Turkey today. For these reasons, I find that the father Appellant would not face a serious possibility of persecution should he return to Turkey. I also find that he would not, on a balance of probabilities, face a risk to life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a danger of torture, were he to return to Turkey. Therefore, I dismiss the father Appellant\u2019s appeal. CONCLUSION With respect to the son Appellant, Selim Ozan Pehlivan, I allow his appeal. I set aside the RPD\u2019s determination and substitute my own determination that he is a Convention refugee. With respect to the father Appellant, Mazhar Pehlivan, I dismiss his appeal. I confirm the decision of the RPD that he is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Selim Ozan Pehlivan', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 42, 'end': 45},

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TB932243 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Dejen Kidus Girma (the Appellant), a citizen of Ethiopia, appeals the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying his claim for refugee protection. The Appellant\u2019s written statement indicates he has not submitted new evidence and does not request that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) hold an oral hearing. He submits that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment and in its assessment of his sur place claim, and asks that the RAD set aside the decision of the RPD and substitute its own determination that he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. DECISION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. BACKGROUND The Appellant fears persecution by the Ethiopian state and Queerroo militias based on his political opinion and Amhara ethnicity. He states that in 2016, he enrolled in AdigratUniversity in the Tigray region of Ethiopia. During his first year, the Appellant got involved in a student protest against the Ethiopian People\u2019s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) government, and that police arrived at the protest and detained the students, including Appellant. The Appellant was threatened and beaten with a police baton. Fearing for his safety, his family sent him to PekingUniversity in China. In March 2018, the Appellant\u2019s parents\u2019 business was looted and destroyed by Queerroo militia in racist attacks. The Appellant\u2019s father, along with some other victims of these attacks, went to the authorities and were accused of being anti-reform and having Oromo-phobia. They were advised to relocate if they were not comfortable living in the Oromo community. As the Appellant could not afford to fund continuation of his studies in China without his parents\u2019 business income, he looked for other options to secure his safety. He did not apply for asylum in China as China does not accept refugees. Thus, the Appellant decided to pursue studies in Canada, and applied for a student visa in July 2018. His student visa was granted on 16 August, 2018. The Appellant left Ethiopia on 27 August, 2018 and arrived in Canada the next day. He filed for refugee protection on January 7, 2019. ANALYSIS Additional evidence per RAD Rule 3(3)(b) and (c) The Appellant has included with the Appellant\u2019s Record a package of documentary evidence which he states was submitted to the RPD as post-hearing disclosure, but which was rejected by the RPD without reasons. RAD Rule 3(3)(c) provides that the Appellant\u2019s Record must include \u201cany documents that the Refugee Protection Division refused to accept as evidence, during or after the hearing, if the appellant wants to rely on the documents in the appeal.\u201d Therefore, these documents need not be assessed as new evidence in accordance with subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA); however, they will be considered in the present appeal. The Appellant\u2019s Record also includes a \u201cpartial transcript\u201d consisting of the Appellant\u2019s answer to one question posed by the RPD at his hearing. There is no evidence that this item is part of the package of post-hearing disclosure rejected by the RPD, and therefore it does not fall under RAD Rule 3(3)(c). This item is relied upon by the Appellant in his Memorandum, and although the Appellant does not refer to the Rule, the RAD acknowledges that the Appellant is entitled to rely on \u201call or part of the transcript\u201d of the RPD hearing pursuant to RAD Rule 3(3)(b). Therefore, this item will be considered in this appeal. Role of the RAD My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. Merits of the Appeal Assessment of the Appellant\u2019s sur place claim The RPD considered the Appellant\u2019s evidence of his involvement in activities in Canada which could be perceived as anti-Ethiopian government, including three Facebook posts, a transcript of a 12-minute radio interview featuring the Appellant, and photos and letters confirming his participation and attendance at four meetings and two political rallies held by Ethiopian diaspora organizations, some of which claim to be perceived by the Ethiopian government as anti-regime. The RPD found that there was no evidence or allegation that any of the Appellant\u2019s activities in Canada have come to the attention of the Ethiopian authorities, and that therefore the Appellant was not a refugee sur place. The Appellant\u2019s argument that the RPD erred in its assessment of his sur place claim is fourfold. He states that the RPD erred in law by importing a good faith requirement into the sur place assessment; that the RPD erred in fact by finding his Canadian activities lacked good faith; that the RPD erred in law by applying the wrong legal test in requiring the Appellant prove that the Ethiopian government have actual knowledge of his activities in Canada; and lastly, that the RPD erred in failing to consider documentary evidence which demonstrates that the Appellant\u2019s political activities in Canada are likely to have come to the attention of the Ethiopian authorities. Appellant\u2019s first and second arguments: whether the Appellant\u2019s actions in Canada demonstrate a good faith opposition to the Ethiopian regime and whether the RPD erred in considering if these activities were undertaken in good faith The RPD states in its decision \u201cThe panel finds, on a balance of probabilities, owing to the credibility concerns, that the claimant has attended some political demonstration[s] and Ethiopian community gatherings in Canada for the purpose of bolstering a refugee claim and not because he is a genuine political opponent of the current regime.\u201d The RPD also finds in respect of the Appellant\u2019s social media posts, that the \u201cposts were made in an attempt to bolster his refugee claim,\u201d and therefore places no weight on them in establishing the sur place element of his claim. While some cases from the Federal Court have held that the RPD is not required to deal with the issue of whether the claimant is a refugee sur place where it determines that the basis of the claim is not credible, other cases have held that the RPD should consider the sur place claim even where it does not believe the account of the experiences in the home country. However, on my reading of the RPD\u2019s decision, it seems not that the RPD was importing a good faith requirement into its assessment of the Appellant\u2019s political activities as alleged by the Appellant, rather that the RPD was not convinced that the Appellant\u2019s motivations for engaging in political activities in Canada were for reasons unrelated to an attempt to bolster his claim for refugee protection. That is to say, since his activities were not credibly attributable to a genuine political belief, it is unlikely on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant would continue to be involved in anti-government activities if he were to return to Ethiopia. Therefore, on a forward-looking basis, it is not credible that he would continue to engage in such activities thus placing him at a risk of persecution in Ethiopia, on a balance of probabilities. I do not agree that the RPD made a legal error in importing a good faith requirement into its assessment of the Appellant\u2019s sur place claim, rather, in finding that the Appellant lacked good faith in making four social media posts, his attendance at four meetings and two rallies held by Ethiopian diaspora groups in Canada, and his statements during a single, 12-minute radio interview the RPD was making a finding that the Appellant\u2019s claim to hold anti-government political views was not, on a balance of probabilities, credible. As such, the Appellant is unlikely to continue these activities if he were to return to Ethiopia, and therefore he is unlikely to face more than a mere possibility of persecution on this basis in Ethiopia. Having reviewed the evidence, I agree. I am likewise not persuaded about the credibility of the Appellant\u2019s alleged anti-government political beliefs. The evidence on record indicates that the Appellant made social media posts on Facebook which he claims are or would be perceived as anti-government. The first is from 17 April, 2019, and appears to contain two photos of the Appellant\u2019s hometown, without commentary. The other three posts are from June, August, and September, 2019, and consist of re-posts (or sharing) of two articles which denounce rising ethnic tensions and the need to seek justice in the Appellant\u2019s hometown. The Appellant has not submitted any new evidence in this appeal to indicate that his anti-government social media presence has continued in the time since his claim was rejected by the RPD. I am not persuaded that the sharing of two articles which were not authored by the Appellant himself, and/or the sharing of two photos, over a total of four dates in 2019 (when the Appellant has been in Canada since August 2018), rises to a level that, on a balance of probabilities, would bring him to the attention of Ethiopian authorities for suspicion of real or perceived anti-government political opposition or beliefs, even when considered in conjunction with the Appellant\u2019s attendance at other events as discussed below. The Appellant argues that the RPD misunderstood the evidence about the nature of the meetings and rallies he attended, by characterizing them as gatherings of the Ethiopian community in Canada as opposed to political events. The Appellant points to evidence that the meeting of 18 July, 2019, was political in nature, as participants were gathered to discuss repression of an Ethiopian journalist. He states that the group issued a press release after the meeting which discussed the detention of Serkalem Fasil. However, a review of the exhibit provided includes no mention of authors to the article, and despite detailed examination, organizers or key actors of the group could not be identified, and I note that the press release does not name him personally. I cannot find that the Appellant is personally identifiable in the press release issued following the meeting, even if it is accepted that he attended. The Appellant also directs the RAD to three subsequent meetings held by Ethiopian diaspora organizations in Canada, which he attended on 14 July, 27 August, and 12 September, 2019, and points to evidence that these gatherings were political in nature, and photos which demonstrate that the Appellant physically attended. The Appellant also directs the RAD to the evidence indicating that the two rallies he attended on July 15 and August 28, 2019, were in opposition to the Ethiopian government and/or its policies. I accept that these meetings and rallies were political in nature as advertised in the promotional flyers, and that the Appellant was in attendance. However, as the RPD noted, the photos indicate mere attendance by the Appellant, and he was one among many attendees. He was not an organizer or a speaker, nor is it alleged that the Appellant had any notable profile or involvement in these meetings or rallies. In light of the credibility concerns with the Appellant\u2019s claim (which are discussed below), the credibility of the Appellant\u2019s motives for attending these four meetings and two rallies, during the nearly two years he has been in Canada, must be examined. I am not persuaded that the Appellant\u2019s passive attendance at these events \u2013 and in two instances, volunteering to assist the organizations hosting the meetings \u2013 credibly demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, the genuineness of his anti-government views. The RAD has also considered the evidence of a further rally the Appellant attended after his RPD hearing on October 13, 2019, and photos which show the Appellant holding anti-government signs, and I accept that the Appellant physically attended and that the event was political in nature. However, even accepting that additional event as one attended by the Appellant there has been no new evidence submitted by the Appellant to show any ongoing anti-government or political activities in the year since this most recent event. I am not persuaded that the additional one event attended raises his political profile such that the conclusions of the RPD would no longer be correct. The totality of the evidence shows that the Appellant is a member of the Ethio-Canadian Network for Advocacy and Support, and that he has attended a total of five political meetings and two rallies in Canada, as one individual without any notable profile, among many other attendees from the Ethiopian diaspora. He has shared on 3-4 occasions some photos and articles authored by others on social media, which appear to show support for the Amhara people in his hometown, and was interviewed on CBC stating, \u201cpeace must be achieved in the region and ECNAS will continue to fiercely support that\u201d about events related to ethnic tensions in his hometown and their effects on the youth of the town. I have no evidence before me that his anti-government political activities have continued subsequent to the rejection of his claim by the RPD on November 4, 2019. Given that the RPD found the Appellant was not a credible witness, the question is whether this evidence demonstrates on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant holds genuine anti-government political opinions such that he is likely to continue his activities, thus demonstrating on a balance of probabilities, that he would face more than a mere possibility of persecution on this basis if he were to return to Ethiopia (I will turn to the likelihood that these activities may come to the attention of Ethiopian authorities below). On the evidence before me, I cannot find that the RPD erred in its assessment of the credibility of his political profile, and I agree with the RPD that the evidence does not show, on a balance of probabilities, a credible or genuine anti-government profile on the part of the Appellant. Now I will turn to whether the Appellant\u2019s activities in Canada, even if not undertaken in good faith, are likely to have come to the attention of Ethiopian authorities, on a balance of probabilities. The Appellant\u2019s third and fourth arguments: there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the Appellant\u2019s low-level political activities in Canada are likely to have come to the attention of Ethiopian authorities The RPD indicated that there was no evidence or allegation that any of the Appellant\u2019s activities in Canada have come to the Ethiopian authorities\u2019 attention. The Appellant argues that in so doing, the RPD placed an erroneous burden on the Appellant to show that the Ethiopian authorities have actual knowledge of his activities, which would amount to an error in law. The Appellant rightly notes that the standard to be applied is whether his activities abroad are likely to have come to the attention of the authorities in Ethiopia. This ties in closely with the Appellant\u2019s argument that the RPD erred by failing to assess the documentary evidence which shows that his activities are likely to have come to the attention of the Ethiopian authorities. While the RPD did refer to documentary evidence speaking to the situation of returnees to Ethiopia who have been politically active in exile, the RPD failed to explicitly consider several of the other applicable items of evidence on this issue. However, I can remedy this by assessing these items in the context of assessing the likelihood that the Appellant\u2019s activities would have or could come to the attention of Ethiopian authorities determining the present appeal. The Appellant points to several items of documentary evidence from the National Documentation Package (NDP) which speak to surveillance of the Ethiopian diaspora by the Ethiopian authorities. Item 4.17 cites anecdotal evidence from members of Unity for Human Rights and Democracy (Unity) Toronto, an Ethiopian organization involved in activities critical of the regime, that relatives or friends in Ethiopia were questioned or threatened after \u201cvideos of [its members\u2019] political activities were seen on YouTube or social media\u201d and provided anecdotal details concerning the alleged monitoring of a supposedly confidential teleconference as well as the surveillance of a particular demonstration in Canada by Ethiopian officials. It goes on to say that \u201ceven though most executive members of [Unity] are Canadian citizens, they will not travel or have never been in Ethiopia for the past 10 years, for fear of being detained, harassed or deported back to Canada .\u201d Other documentary evidence indicates that the Ethiopian regime \u201cmonitors the activities of members of the diaspora constantly,\u201d and members of the diaspora who are politically engaged against the regime risk being detained in the airport or jailed, the same source says that after the nomination of the new Prime Minister, the situation for the diaspora \u201cwould be less threatening and that members of the diaspora are less worried for their safety than before because of the significant change in political situation.\u201d The report cited by the RPD in its reasons indicates that \u201cEthiopian authorities \u2018have informants who attend public events\u2019 . . . although, \u2018[a] lot of this is just for intel[ligence] gathering\u201d, and that there are \u201c[v]arying opinions on how high a profile you need to be in order to be monitored this way\u201d, including that \u201csometimes\u201d low-profile people are monitored. It also indicates that there was limited information on what has happened with Ethiopians in exile who return to Ethiopia after being critical of the regime, but that \u201cindividuals who are known dissidents are at a high risk of detention.\u201d The item also cites Landinfo, the Norwegian Country of Origin Information Centre, which states that \u201cthose who will be under the Ethiopian authorities\u2019 suspicion are, first and foremost, people they apprehend as a threat and who may mobilize and are prepared to use military force for change.\u201d Another source cited by the Appellant supports the position that the Ethiopian government surveillance of the diaspora in Europe and the United States of America can include low profile and less vocal anti-government agitators. The Appellant argues the country condition documents indicate that low-level dissidents or agitators \u201ccould\u201d be persecuted upon return. I cannot find that the Appellant\u2019s profile, characterized by passive attendance or at best, volunteering, at a limited number of public events in Canada, would be sufficient to attract the attention of Ethiopian authorities, even as a \u201clow-level\u201d political activist. Simply put, the Appellant has not demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that his limited, passive activities among the Ethiopian diaspora in Canada raise his profile to a level of being someone who could be characterized even as a \u201clow-profile and less vocal anti-government agitator,\u201d as cited in the documentary evidence. While the Appellant has provided photos of him participating in rallies and attending meetings, there is insufficient evidence regarding how any spy or informant for the Ethiopian government would identify him personally from those photos. The Appellant has not alleged that he was or is a leader, organizer, or speaker at any of these events, and there is nothing on the record to show that he would even be recognizable or personally identifiable by any prospective government spy or informant which might be surveilling the few events which the Appellant has attended. While there is one photo the Appellant took of having signed his name to a register of attendees at a demonstration against the Ethiopian government regarding \u201cthe violation of [the] principle of secularism and the existence of political disorder in the country\u201d, I am not satisfied having signed his name to this list of participants at a single event held in Canada brings the Appellant\u2019s profile to a point where it could be said that he would be personally identifiable or of interest to Ethiopian authorities, or that his political activities in Canada are \u201clikely\u201d to come to the attention of the Ethiopian authorities, on a balance of probabilities. I have considered the possibility that the Appellant\u2019s radio interview might have made him personally identifiable, however, the transcript of the interview indicates that the Appellant was only identified by his first name, and the interview itself did not contain any personal identifiers which could be used to personally identify the Appellant. While the Facebook posts were made under his own profile bearing his first and last name, I am not persuaded that reposting or sharing a very limited number of photos and articles written by someone else is sufficient to attract the interest of Ethiopian authorities, and such activities cannot be said to be \u201clikely\u201d to have come to the authorities\u2019 attention on a balance of probabilities, given the Appellant\u2019s ultra low political profile. Therefore, I cannot find on the evidence before me that the limited, low-level involvement in political activities in Canada such as those undertaken by the Appellant can be said to have likely come to the attention of the Ethiopian authorities, on a balance of probabilities. Therefore, I do not find that the Appellant is a refugee sur place. The RPD did not err in assessing the Appellant\u2019s credibility Credibility concerns arising from the Appellant\u2019s testimony related to events at AdigratUniversity The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of his credibility by making negative credibility findings which are microscopic, and by misapprehending core aspects of his claim. First, the Appellant states that the RPD erred by considering that the arrest, detention and assault by police, which he claimed to have experienced as a student at AdigratUniversity, was central to his claim. The Appellant notes that the RPD made three negative credibility findings arising from his testimony about his experience of being arrested, detained and beaten by police, following a demonstration at AdigratUniversity. Yet the Appellant now argues that although he felt unsafe there, he still felt safe elsewhere in Ethiopia until the destruction of his parents\u2019 business in March 2018. Thus, the Appellant argues, the events at AdigratUniversity were peripheral to his refugee claim, and that therefore no adverse inference from his testimony on these events is warranted. I cannot agree. In his Basis of Claim (BOC) form narrative, the Appellant emphasizes this experience in setting out his basis of claim: \u201cI am applying for refugee protection in Canada because my life is at risk in Ethiopia because of my ethnic identity, political views and family profile. My family and I were subjected to unlawful arrest and harassment due to our ethnicity and perceived political opinion. I have endured physical and psychological attacks at the hands of the agents of EPRDF during my stay at AdigratUniversity.\u201d The Appellant detailed extensively in his BOC the events he experienced following his participation in a student protest at AdigratUniversity, and he testified in detail about this experience as well. It is not now open for the Appellant to assert that the events which he claims he personally experienced at AdigratUniversity and, in part due to which he claims he fears persecution in Ethiopia, were merely peripheral details and, therefore, his inconsistent or contradicting testimony about these events, as set out by the RPD, ought not to be held against him. It is noteworthy that the arrest, detention and assault at the hands of police is the only event detailed in his BOC which the Appellant admits to having personally experienced. The destruction of his parents\u2019 business in Dire Dawa while he was living in hiding with his aunt in Addis Ababa is the other major event detailed in his BOC as underlying his claim for protection, but he did not personally experience those events. I do not accept the Appellant\u2019s position that his testimony relating to events at AdigratUniversity is peripheral to his claim, and therefore credibility concerns noted by the RPD arising therefrom are in error. These events were detailed extensively in his BOC and form a significant basis for his claim, and the Appellant therefore ought to be expected to be able to testify credibly about them. I see no reason to disturb the negative credibility findings of the RPD with respect to contradictions and inconsistencies arising from the Appellant\u2019s testimony about the events at AdigratUniversity. For example, the RPD made a negative credibility inference about the Appellant\u2019s two returns to Ethiopia in April and May 2018 from China and found that his returns were indicative of a lack of subjective fear. The Appellant states that his first return from April 1 to April 15, 2018, should not be held against him, as when he returned in early May of 2018, the only negative event which had occurred was from his time at AdigratUniversity which do not relate to the core of his claim, and thus his return at that time does not indicate a lack of subjective fear. Not only do I not accept this argument for the reasons above relating to the apparent centrality of the Appellant\u2019s arrest, detention and assault at AdigratUniversity which he cannot now disavow, but I find this argument is moot given that even after the alleged destruction of his parents\u2019 business on March 28, 2018, the Appellant nonetheless returned to Ethiopia from his studies in China in April 2018. The Appellant admits he returned a second time from May to early June 2018, which return he explained by asserting that he did not know he could fly directly to Canada from anywhere other than Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This explanation was rejected by the RPD in consideration of the Appellant\u2019s education and past travel history. I, too, reject this explanation, because of evidence of the Appellant\u2019s education and sophistication with prior travel abroad, and as well because he remained in Ethiopia for a period of time, not simply for a brief day or so, to take a flight to Canada. As such, the Appellant\u2019s argument that the first return to Ethiopia should not be held against him is rejected as moot, as I draw a negative credibility inference and find the Appellant\u2019s actions in returning to his country in April and May 2018, were not reasonably explained and indicate a lack of subjective fear in Ethiopia. I agree with the RPD in finding that the Appellant\u2019s two returns to Ethiopia in 2018 undermine the credibility of his claim, and his assertion that he holds a subjective fear of return to Ethiopia. In addition, the RPD found not credible the Appellant\u2019s evidence of how he was beaten by the police during his detention at AdigratUniversity in March 2016. He testified that he was \u201cbeaten\u201d by police shoes on his back, while the Appellant\u2019s BOC narrative indicate that the police beat his back with a baton, which the Appellant explained was a mistake on his BOC and which explanation was not accepted as reasonable by the RPD. I agree. I also do not find that this inconsistency arose from a microscopic examination of the evidence by the RPD, as alleged. As noted above, this was the only incident underlying his claim which the Appellant alleges he personally experienced, and as such, it is reasonable to expect him to testify credibly to the details he has provided in his BOC and in testimony including whether he was beaten with a baton by police, or whether he was kicked with their shoes. The RPD also drew an adverse inference from the Appellant\u2019s failure to corroborate his injury arising from the beating at AdigratUniversity with medical evidence, given his testimony that he regained consciousness in a medical clinic but that he had not sought evidence in support of this because there was a \u201cdisturbance\u201d and since the students had left \u201cthey would not be happy if he were to contact them again\u201d. I agree that the Appellant has not reasonably explained his lack of efforts to obtain reasonably available evidence to support his claim, in particular, medical evidence to corroborate that he was treated for injuries following the protest he alleges to have attended at AdigratUniversity. I have rejected the Appellant\u2019s arguments that these credibility concerns are in error because the elements of his claim related to his experience while attending AdigratUniversity do not constitute a core element of his claim. I find that these credibility concerns are correct, and the Appellant\u2019s assertion on appeal that these events do not constitute a central issue in his claim does not accord with the narrative he provided in his BOC, nor does it obviate the expectation that he would be able to testify credibly and consistently about them. ii. Credibility concerns arising from the Appellant\u2019s student visa application to Canada The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in fact by drawing a negative credibility inference from the perceived inconsistency about when the Appellant applied for his Canadian student visa. Indeed, the RPD found there was a discrepancy between the Appellant\u2019s testimony and the BOC that he applied for his student visa to Canada after his parents\u2019 business was destroyed on March 28, 2018, when the record shows he applied for it in July 2018, before he alleged he feared for his life. However, the Appellant is correct that his BOC indicates he applied for his student visa on March 28, 2018. Therefore, I accept the Appellant\u2019s explanation for his testimony indicating that he applied for his student visa in July 2018 as having meant that March 2018 was when he decided to apply for asylum in Canada. I draw no negative inference from this exchange; however, I find this point is not determinative, as I agree with the remainder of the RPD\u2019s negative credibility findings and overall credibility assessment. iii. Credibility concerns arising from the omission of the two times the Appellant alleges he was in hiding at his aunt\u2019s home in Addis Ababa The Appellant argues that the RPD made credibility findings which were microscopic in making a negative finding about where the Appellant was when he claims his parents\u2019 business was destroyed in March 2018. The RPD drew a negative inference from the fact that the Appellant testified he was in hiding at his aunt\u2019s home in Addis Ababa when he found out his parents\u2019 business was destroyed in Dire Dawa in March 2018, and found this testimony was inconsistent with his BOC which stated he was in China. The Appellant states this is a microscopic examination of the evidence, as his BOC merely states that this event occurred while he was a student in China, not that he was physically in China at the time the business was destroyed. The BOC states that the Appellant learned of the destruction of his parents\u2019 business \u201cwhile [he] was studying\u2026 in China\u2026\u201d Therefore, while I am prepared to accept as reasonable the Appellant\u2019s explanation for what the RPD perceived as an inconsistency and draw no negative inference from the inconsistency itself, I am not prepared to find that the negative credibility finding relating to these overarching facts is incorrect. In the RAD\u2019s view, the central issue related to the Appellant\u2019s whereabouts in April and May of 2018 when he returned to Ethiopia (in addition to the concern regarding lack of subjective fear and credibility related to the return to Ethiopia itself), is that the Appellant failed to mention in his BOC that he was \u201cin hiding\u201d at his aunt\u2019s house when he returned so as to ensure he did not have any problems while he was back in Ethiopia. The RPD faulted the Appellant for omitting in both his BOC and refugee intake form any reference to the fact that he was \u201cin hiding\u201d at his aunt\u2019s in Addis Ababa during these two returns to his country in 2018, and rejected the Appellant\u2019s explanation that he only included permanent addresses in his refugee intake form as a reason that it did not reflect the time he testified he was living with his aunt. I am prepared to accept the Appellant\u2019s explanation for this omission from his refugee intake form address history, however, this explanation does not reasonably account for why his BOC narrative also omits any reference to the time he alleges he spent in Addis Ababa, and in particular the Appellant\u2019s perceived need to live in hiding at his aunt\u2019s house during his two returns to Ethiopia. I find it is inconsistent for the Appellant to claim that he felt he needed to live in hiding at his aunt\u2019s house in Addis Ababa during his first return in April to May 2018, given that his parents\u2019 business had not yet been destroyed prior to March 28, 2018, and given his argument on appeal that the prior events he experienced at AdigratUniversity were peripheral, and not part of the core of his claim. The Appellant testified that he was not wanted by Ethiopian authorities, and therefore there is no credible reason to explain his testimony that he was in hiding with his aunt as early as his first return on April 1, 2018. I find there is no reasonable explanation for his testimony to be inconsistent with his BOC which omits mention of a material detail: the Appellant\u2019s perceived necessity to live in hiding with his aunt in Addis Ababa during his two returns to Ethiopia in 2018. I agree with the RPD in drawing a negative credibility inference from this omission, and the lack of a reasonable explanation therefor. The Appellant has submitted a partial transcript to evidence the fact that part of his answer relating to why he did not disclose his aunt\u2019s address on his refugee intake form was a statement not attributable to him, but rather, was added by the interpreter. I find the Appellant\u2019s argument that he did not testify to the words attributed to him by the interpreter at the RPD hearing in response to one question posed by the RPD, as reflected in this small partial transcript, is not determinative. The Appellant does not argue that interpretation errors were pervasive or persistent, merely that one portion of the answer to the Panel\u2019s question about why his intake form does not mention he was living with his aunt was not attributable to him. As such, there is no argument about procedural fairness in respect of interpretation, and as I draw no conclusion from the portion of the answer the Appellant claims is not attributable to him, this single alleged interpretation issue is not determinative of the credibility of the Appellant, or any other point in issue in the present appeal. iv. Supporting documents [38] The Appellant also argues that the RPD erred in finding his father\u2019s letter insufficient to overcome the above-noted credibility concerns, because the reasons reference the fact that his father\u2019s letter, like the Appellant\u2019s BOC, omits mention of the Appellant living in hiding with his aunt during his two returns to Ethiopia in April and May of 2018. The Appellant argues the RPD erred in law by assessing the letter for what it does not say, rather than what it does say. However, even giving the Appellant\u2019s father\u2019s support letter full weight with respect to the events recounted therein, I find this unsworn letter is insufficient evidence to overcome the numerous and material credibility concerns noted above which arose from the Appellant\u2019s own evidence. I agree with the RPD in finding that, notwithstanding this letter, the Appellant has not credibly established material elements of his claim, on a balance of probabilities. No breach of procedural fairness from the rejection of the Appellant\u2019s post-hearing disclosure package by the RPD The Appellant argues that the RPD breached his right to procedural fairness by dismissing the post-hearing disclosure package submitted by the Appellant, without providing reasons. He also argues that the rejected disclosure warrants setting aside of the RPD\u2019s rejection of his claim, as the documents could have had a material effect on the decision.", "spans": "[{'text':

{"doc_text": " RAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAR : MC009401 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision \u2013 Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW The appellant, Daniel Pierre, is a citizen of Haiti. He fears that if he were to return to Haiti, he will be killed by a group of criminals from his neighbourhood led by Raphael Peterson Bien-Aime. These criminals want revenge because one of them, named Emmanuel Felix, died after being arrested for stealing a laptop that belonged to the appellant\u2019s daughter. He is appealing the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) decision rejecting his claim for refugee protection. He argues that the RPD erred in its assessment of his credibility. He also argues that the RPD breached the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. For the reasons set out below, the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) concludes that the RPD breached the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness by refusing to admit the photographs submitted by the appellant into evidence. For the purposes of this appeal, the RAD is admitting these photographs into evidence. Furthermore, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD made certain errors in its credibility assessment. Nevertheless, the RAD finds that the appellant\u2019s credibility was undermined regarding his allegations that criminals are looking for him in Haiti. The appeal is dismissed. ANALYSIS The RAD conducted an independent assessment of the evidence, including listening to the recording of the hearing. The RAD applied the standard of correctness. The Refugee Protection Division breached the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness For the reasons set out below, the RAD concludes that the RPD breached the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness by refusing to admit into evidence the bundled photographs submitted by the appellant, namely photographs of his daughter, the photograph of a man, along with the photograph of and wanted notice for Raphael Peterson Bien-Aime. The RAD concludes that the appropriate remedy is to admit these photographs into evidence. The RAD agrees with the appellant. Even though the copies received by the RPD via fax were not clear, the RPD should have considered that the appellant was unable to deliver the originals to the RPD due to the closure of the RPD Registry because of the COVID19 situation. Furthermore, the appellant\u2019s hearing was held by videoconference. The appellant attempted to show the photographs on camera, but the RPD refused to consider them. This is an error. The RAD nonetheless has a copy of these documents, which are part of the RPD record. These photographs are clear enough for the RAD to consider them. Consequently, the RAD is of the opinion that the appropriate remedy in this case is to admit these documents into evidence. These documents are therefore admitted into evidence as P-1 in a bundle. The RAD considers that the appellant submitted two photographs that show a young girl Irina Widelene Pierre. The RAD accepts that this is the appellant\u2019s daughter. The appellant also submitted a photograph of a man looking to the left, along with the photograph of Raphael Peterson Bien-Aime and a wanted notice for him. According to the wanted notice, Raphael Peterson Bien-Aime is wanted by the Haitian national police for murder and membership in a criminal organization. The RAD accepts the existence of criminals named Emmanuel Felix and Raphael Peterson Bien-Aime. The RAD also accepts that Raphael Peterson Bien-Aime is wanted by the Haitian national police for murder and membership in a criminal organization. No nexus to the Convention It is worth mentioning that the appellant is not challenging the RPD\u2019s conclusion that his claim for refugee protection has no nexus to one of the five Convention grounds. Considering that the appellant fears criminals who are targeting him for criminal reasons, the RAD sees no error and agrees with this conclusion. As stated above, the appellant claims that the RPD erred in its assessment of his credibility. The errors made by the Refugee Protection Division Failure to mention the exchange of gunfire The RAD agrees with the appellant. The RPD erred when it made an adverse credibility finding based on the appellant\u2019s failure to mention in his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) that, in the incident where Emmanuel Felix was allegedly arrested by the police on June 10, 2016, the police and the criminals exchanged gunfire. As the appellant argues, one of the purposes of the RPD hearing is to allow refugee protection claimants to provide explanations and present their accounts in greater detail. In his BOC Form, the appellant mentions a police raid in the neighbourhood. In the RAD\u2019s view, the fact that gunfire was allegedly exchanged is merely an addition that the appellant could introduce at the hearing, not a material omission in the BOC Form. Consequently, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD erred when it made an adverse credibility finding based on the appellant\u2019s failure to mention in his BOC Form that the criminals and the police exchanged gunfire on June 10, 2016. Microscopic and irrelevant analysis of the evidence The RAD agrees with the appellant. The RPD erred when it made an adverse credibility finding based on a contradiction regarding the date the appellant entered the United States in August 2016. As the appellant argues, whether he entered the United States on August 15 or 16, 2016, is not a relevant factor. The appellant does not allege that any incident occurred in Haiti during this period. Moreover, approximately four years had passed since the appellant\u2019s stay in the United States. The appellant may simply have made a mistake regarding the dates during his testimony. Whatever the reason for this contradiction, it has no impact on the appellant\u2019s account. As a result, the RPD erred when it relied on this contradiction to make an adverse credibility finding. The appellant\u2019s credibility regarding his allegations of threats was undermined Despite the aforementioned errors made by the RPD, the RAD nonetheless concludes that the appellant\u2019s credibility was undermined regarding the existence of death threats against him and his allegations that criminals are looking for him. It is worth mentioning that the appellant is not challenging the RPD\u2019s finding that his credibility regarding his allegations that criminals are looking for him was undermined by his failure to mention in his BOC Form that, since his departure from Haiti, the criminals have gone to his home and have persecuted his wife and daughter. The RAD sees no error and agrees with this finding. In addition, the appellant is not challenging the RPD\u2019s conclusion that he has failed to demonstrate that the barricades erected by the criminals while commuting on a public bus full of passengers were intended for him. The RAD sees no error and agrees with this conclusion. The appellant is, however, challenging the RPD\u2019s conclusion that there is no evidence that Emmanuel was arrested and imprisoned for stealing his daughter\u2019s laptop. He argues that the photographs he submitted, which the RPD should have admitted into evidence, corroborate his testimony. The RAD does not accept these arguments. As noted above, the RAD admitted the appellant\u2019s photographs into evidence. While the wanted notice demonstrates Raphael Peterson Bien-Aime\u2019s existence and his membership in a criminal group, it does not establish that he is wanted for stealing a laptop. As mentioned earlier, this document states that he is wanted for murder. The appellant did not present any evidence that Emmanuel Felix was charged by the police for stealing a laptop. The appellant testified that after he called the police telephone number to report the theft of the laptop, apart from the fact that the laptop was not found, the police did not follow up with him. Moreover, while Emmanuel Felix was allegedly arrested in June 2016 and died in custody in July 2017, it was not until September 22, 2017, that the appellant was allegedly confronted at the first barricade, which he perceived as a direct threat. However, as mentioned above, the appellant has failed to demonstrate that the barricades were intended for him. Considering the above, namely the lack of evidence regarding the reasons for Emmanuel Felix\u2019s arrest, the appellant\u2019s failure to demonstrate that he was personally targeted by the criminals in Haiti, and the fact that his daughter and wife, who remained in Haiti, have reportedly experienced no problems, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD did not err in concluding that the appellant has failed to demonstrate that the criminals were looking for him. In light of the above, the RAD concludes that the RPD\u2019s final decision is correct. The appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution on one of the five Convention grounds or demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that if he returned to Haiti, he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, a risk to his life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment under subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. DECISION The RAD dismisses the appeal. It confirms the RPD\u2019s determination that Daniel Pierre is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200122 Docket: IMM-2069-19 Citation: 2020 FC 19 Citation: 2020 FC 19 Ottawa, Ontario, January 22 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Annis BETWEEN: A.B. Applicant and MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent and HIV AND AIDS LEGAL CLINIC ONTARIO Intervener JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Introduction [1] A.B. [the Applicant], a Canadian citizen originally from India, seeks judicial review of the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD]\u2019s decision [Decision] to dismiss her sponsorship appeal. Her appeal concerned an immigration officer\u2019s [the Officer] refusal to issue a permanent resident visa to her husband[the spouse]. [2] The IAD made a confidentiality order, requiring the names of the Applicant and other family members, and identifying characteristics to be redacted from its reasons and decision, in accordance with section 166(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. The IAD issued this order because the Applicant\u2019s spouse is from a vulnerable community in India, and will face prosecution for being HIV positive should his identity be revealed. These reasons and the materials on file in support of the application are subject to a similar confidentiality order. [3] The HIV and AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario [the Clinic] has been given leave to intervene in this matter. The Clinic submits that the IAD\u2019s decision perpetuates HIV-related stigma by relying on discriminatory stereotypes of people living with HIV, and other related submissions. [4] For the reasons that follow, the application is dismissed. II. Facts A. Factual context [5] The Applicant is a naturalized citizen of Canada, originating from India. In April, 1997, she arrived to Canada as a sponsored spouse by her first husband. However, they divorced the same year. They did not have children together. In 2003, the Applicant received her citizenship. [6] The Applicant then sponsored her second husband but in 2011, their marriage ended. They had two children, one who is a young adult who lives with his father, and a teenage boy who lives with the Applicant. [7] The spouse, the Applicant\u2019s current husband, was previously married with another woman in an arranged marriage. This woman also sponsored the Applicant\u2019s husband to Canada as a spouse. Upon completing his immigration medical exam, the spouse discovered that he was HIV-positive. [8] In 2010, the spouse was denied entry upon arriving in Canada, because his ex wife had withdrawn her sponsorship. The spouse alleges that at that time he met a lawyer at the airport who advised him to make a refugee claim, claiming that his life was at risk in India, and that everything would \u201cnormalize.\u201d He followed the lawyer\u2019s advice despite being of the opinion that he was not a legitimate refugee claimant. [9] In 2011, the spouse withdrew his claim at the hearing before the RPD. He alleges that his lawyer advised him that he could not do so before that time. [10] After withdrawing his refugee claim in 2011, the spouse then made a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRRA) application based on the risk to his life or lack of proper medical care for his medical condition, along with a Humanitarian and Compassionate application (H&C). [11] In 2012, the spouse\u2019s marriage with his ex wife ended in divorce without any children. [12] In 2013, after the spouse\u2019s PRRA and H&C claims were dismissed, the spouse received his removal order to leave Canada two or three weeks later. However, he did not attend that appointment and did not leave Canada. Instead, he quit his job and went into hiding. [13] Later in 2013, the Applicant married the spouse whom she had first met two months previously. This is the Applicant\u2019s\u2019 third marriage and the spouse\u2019s second marriage. [14] At the end of the same year, in 2013, the couple submitted an In-Canada Spousal Sponsorship application. They claim a lawyer advised them (erroneously) that they could avoid the spouse\u2019s removal if they submitted the sponsorship application. They were further advised that they should remain in Canada throughout the processing of this application. [15] The spouse was arrested in 2014 on a removal warrant and was deported to India a month later. However, the Applicant and spouse have remained married to date and conducted themselves as married despite the geographical separation. They have no children together. [16] The Applicant applied to sponsor the spouse as a permanent resident, but the Officer refused the application in 2016. The Officer concluded that the marriage is not genuine, and was entered into by the spouse primarily for the purpose of acquiring status or privilege per section 4 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations]. [17] The Applicant appealed the decision to the IAD, which dismissed the appeal in 2019. B. The IAD Decision [18] The IAD dismissed the appeal after concluding that the Applicant failed to prove that the marriage was not entered into primarily for the purpose of the spouse acquiring a status or privilege under the IRPA. The IAD acknowledged that their marriage now appears genuine, but that the test under section 4 of the Regulations is disjunctive. [19] The IAD concluded that overall, the Applicant\u2019s evidence was credible, but that the spouse was not. She found on a balance of probabilities that, while the marriage was genuine, the spouse entered into it primarily for the purpose of acquiring a benefit under the IRPA, thereby dismissing the appeal. [20] The IAD considered that the marriage is genuine on a balance of probabilities for two main reasons: (1) the solid documentary evidence from the five years of marriage submitted by the Applicant and; (2) the spouse\u2019s daily interaction with both the Applicant and her son, who refers to him as his father. [21] The IAD then noted that the spouse\u2019s motivation to marry was to acquire any status or privilege under the IRPA (gaining permanent residency), based on his significant immigration history in Canada, his ongoing serious medical condition, and the timing of his marriage. In reaching this conclusion, after setting out the factors generally considered in the manner of their determining, the IAD considered the following six factors: The spouse demonstrated a desire to stay in Canada starting from his arrival: The IAD considered that the spouse\u2019s decision to file a refugee claim upon his first arrival to Canada weighed against his credibility, including allegations of relying upon his lawyer for these decisions. The IAD found there was no persuasive answer for her question as to why he did not return to India. This evidence weighed against the spouse\u2019s credibility and supported a finding that he desired to stay in Canada regardless of whether he was with his then-spouse or not. The spouse stayed in Canada despite having no contact with his then-spouse: The lack of involvement by family members to attempt to unite the couple in an arranged marriage called into question its genuineness. He failed to see his then-spouse again after meeting her in the airport until the refugee hearing. The IAD concluded when it was clear that there was no reconciliation with his first sponsor, the decision of the spouse to remain in Canada supported the finding that the prioritized remaining in Canada despite not having a spouse here. The spouse\u2019s further attempts to stay in Canada: The IAD concluded that the spouse\u2019s failure to withdraw his refugee claim until 2011 on the unsupported advice of his lawyer, and thereafter by commencing is PRRA and H&C applications were further evidence of the spouse\u2019s determination to stay in Canada and weighed against his credibility. The IAD also considered that his \u201cflagrant disregard\u201d for Canada\u2019s immigration laws by not leaving 2013 and going into hiding was further evidence of his determination to stay in Canada. The RAD found these actions to weigh in favour a finding the spouse\u2019s primary purpose for his marriage to the Applicant was to stay in Canada. The timing of the decision to marry and the marriage date: The IAD concluded that the Applicant and spouse had only been together for about two months. They were married few weeks after he advised her of his removal order of2013. The spouse admitted that the marriage proposal was rushed and was to ensure that he could stay in Canada, as a way to continue develop his relationship with the Applicant. The IAD did not accept his claim that he was not pressuring the Applicant to marry him. He further explained that another lawyer erroneously advised him that he could avoid the removal order if the couple submitted an In-Canada Spousal Sponsorship application, even though at large and in violation of the immigration laws. The IAD did not believe in a balance of probabilities that the decision to marry was made after the consultation with the lawyer. The IAD also noted that the fact that the marriage was entered into rather hastily, given that they are entering to their second and third marriages respectively, also weighed in favour of the Applicant\u2019s primary purpose of the marriage being to stay in Canada. The spouse considered marrying another Canadian woman: The IAD concluded that the timing of his search for another mate was indicative on a balance of probabilities that he was looking for a way to stay in Canada rather than to marry to be a spouse. This came after the first sponsorship was over, and after the withdrawal of the refugee claim, while awaiting the PRRA and H&C decisions. Similarly, his focus on finding a Canadian partner so that he could stay in Canada was corroborated by his testimony that he also considered marrying another Canadian woman he had met. The spouse\u2019s motivation to access treatment and medication for his HIV: The IAD found that spouse was highly motivated to stay in Canada because he believed he was saving his own life. This conclusion was fortified by the spouse\u2019s testimony that there was no treatment for his HIV in India available to him until he showed more symptoms of illness, and that the medications received in Canada were not available to him in India. In addition, the IAD considered that the spouse\u2019s working to fund his medical needs further supports the finding that he was motivated to do what it took to stay in Canada. III. Issues [22] The Court accepts the following issues raised by the Applicant and the Intervener: What is the standard of review? Was the IAD\u2019s assessment of the primary purpose of the spouse\u2019s marriage unreasonable? Did the IAD unreasonably rely on the spouse\u2019s medical condition to undermine the primary purpose of the marriage? Did the IAD err by making speculative findings that were unfounded and contradicted by the evidentiary record? Should the Court permit a new issue to be raised not before the IAD concerning whether the disjunctive test in s. 4(1) of Regulations is ultra vires the enabling statute, namely s. 3(1)(d) of IRPA, and if so whether the test is ultra vires? Does the IAD decision perpetuate HIV-related stigma by relying on discriminatory stereotypes of people living in HIV, whether the decision creates a discriminatory evidentiary burden of people living with HIV, and whether the IDA erred in failing to conduct an individualized assessment of the Applicant\u2019s ability to access medical care? IV. Standard of Review [23] By the revised principles in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] S.C.J. No. 65 at para. 26 [Vavilov], reasonableness is presumed to be the applicable standard of review for all aspects of the decision. None of the exceptions described in Vavilov would affect the presumption that the reasonableness standard should apply in this matter. [24] The reviewing court no longer attempts to ascertain the \"range\" of possible reasonable conclusions that would have been open to the decision maker. Instead, a reasonable decision is concerned with the decision-making process and its outcomes. A reasonable decision is also based both on an internally coherent reasoning, and justified in light of the legal and factual constraints that bear on the decision such that the decision as a whole is transparent, intelligible and justified. Therefore, \u201cit is not enough for the outcome of a decision to be justifiable... the decision must also be justified.\u201d (Vavilov, paras. 15, 83 and 86). [25] Regarding the first factor, the reasoning must be both rational and logical, allowing the reviewing court to trace the decision maker\u2019s reasoning without encountering any fatal flaws in its overarching logic and following a line of analysis that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived, (Vavilov, para 102). It is not enough for the outcome of a decision to be justifiable. ... the decision must also be justified\u201d (Vavilov, para 86). [26] In the second instance, a reasonable decision is justified in light of the particular legal and factual constraints that bear on the decision (Vavilov, para 83). It is not possible to catalog all of the legal and factual considerations that could constrain an administrative decision-maker in a particular case. However, elements that are relevant in this matter in evaluating whether a given decision is reasonable include the governing statutory scheme; other relevant statutory or common law; the evidence before the decision maker; the submissions of the parties; and the potential impact of the decision on the individual to whom it applies. [27] With respect to the constraints on assessed factual findings, which extends to the drawing of inferences of fact: (1) applicants must demonstrate; that (2) exceptional circumstances apply, which would permit the reviewing court to interfere with factual findings; and that (3) they are not requesting the court to re-weigh and reassess the evidence considered by the decision-maker(Vavilov, paras 77 & 125, Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 SCC 31, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 230, at para 55; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 (CanLII), [2009] 1 SCR 339 at para 64, or where it concludes that the decision-maker\u2019s factual conclusion cannot be said to be based on some evidence: Dr. Q. v College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, 2003 SCC 19 (CanLII), [2003] 1 SCR 226, at para. 41. [28] The need for deference is greatly heightened by the nature of the problem. Assessments of credibility are quintessentially questions of fact. The relative advantage enjoyed by the Committee, who heard the viva voce evidence, must be respected; Vavilov, para. 125, citing Dr. Q. v College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, 2003 SCC 19 (CanLII), [2003] 1 SCR 226, at para 38. [29] The Court further noted at paragraph 125 in Vavilov in referencing Housen v. Nikolaisen, 2002 SCC 33 (CanLII), [2002] 2 SCR 235, at paras. 15-18 [Housen] that appellate courts\u2019 deference owed to a lower court's factual findings, including the need for judicial efficiency, the importance of preserving certainty and public confidence, and the relatively advantageous position of the first instance decision maker, apply equally in the context of judicial review. The ratio decidendi of Housen at paragraphs 22 & 23 that appellate courts are not to reweigh the primary evidence to substitute their conclusion for that of the decision maker in the drawing of an inferred fact, would similarly apply to inferences drawn by administrative tribunals. [30] Otherwise based on Vavilov at paragraphs 77 and 126, and the jurisprudence it cites, applicants must demonstrate that the decision is not reasonable because it is not justified in light of the facts based on the evidence that was actually before the decision-maker. This would include where the decision maker has not taken the evidentiary record and the general factual matrix that bears on its decision into account. Examples include where there is a flawed logical process by which the fact is drawn from the evidence, or where the decision maker has fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the relevant evidence, or made a finding that was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence, : Vavilov at para. 77 &126; Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 (CanLII), [2008] 1 SCR 190, at para 47; Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para 48; Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v Southam Inc., 1997 CanLII 385 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 748, at para 56; Dr. Q. para. 41. [31] With respect to questions of mixed fact and law, logically if any identifiable underlying factual findings are not overturned and overriding in effect, applicants must demonstrate an unreasonable error in their consideration and application, per Vavilov para. 127. Given the general deference owed the factual component of the question, the Court infers that such errors are most likely the absence of justified reasoning, the deficiencies of the reasoning process applied, or an error in the extricable legal principle, such as misstating or applying the wrong test. See the general discussion on questions of mixed fact and law in Housen at paras. 26 to 31. V. Analysis A. Introduction [32] This matter is highly fact determinative in the sense that the Applicant\u2019s submissions are rejected in most instances based upon the facts. [33] First, the Member found that the spouse was highly motivated to obtain permanent resident status for the purpose of accessing Canada\u2019s HIV treatment and medication resources, over many years prior to the marriage with the Applicant. This includes the following: gaining entry to Canada on the basis of a spousal sponsorship claim that ended upon his arrival in the country; falsely claiming refugee status; discontinuing the application a year later at the hearing on the unfounded premise that he was following his lawyer\u2019s instructions; further failed PRRA and H&C applications; thereafter remaining unlawfully at large due to his refusal to return to his country of origin; further consideration of a marriage with another Canadian citizen; ultimately meeting the Applicant with the marriage concluded two months later; and, thereafter, the Applicant making a sponsorship application for the spouse when unlawfully in the country on the unfounded premise that the lawyer advised that it would allow him to remain in the country. [34] Second, the Member concluded that the marriage was not genuine when first entered into, but was genuine at the time when considered by the IAD. [35] Third, the Member found that the Applicant\u2019s spouse was not credible. [36] The Court further finds nothing to suggest that the reasons were not rational and logical, allowing the reviewing court to trace the decision maker\u2019s reasoning without encountering any fatal flaws in its overarching logic and following a line of analysis that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived. B. The IAD\u2019s assessment of the primary purpose of the Applicant\u2019s marriage is reasonable and is not constrained by any of the allegations and submissions considered below (1) The IAD is not constrained by an alleged misunderstanding of the applicable legal framework for assessing the primary purpose of the marriage in failing to consider the genuineness of the marriage [37] The Applicant\u2019s first argument is that the IAD\u2019s assessment of the primary rational purpose of marriage was unreasonable because the Member applied the wrong legal framework. He states that the IAD having found that the marriage was genuine, erred in not logically considering this conclusion as proof that the couple was not seeking immigration status. He relies upon the statement in Parminder Kaur Gill v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 902 at para 15 [the 2014 Gill decision] that \u201c[t]he more compelling the proof that the couple was seeking immigration status, the more likely it will be that the marriage was not genuine.\u201d [38] With respect, it is recognized that there may be a wide range of different circumstances pertaining to each marriage. It is always a question therefore, whether the facts support a conclusion that a genuine marriage for instance would be proof that the spouse was not seeking immigration status. [39] In this matter, the facts do not indicate any significant relation between the two factors. As indicated, the most highly probative evidence that the spouse was seeking an immigration status for the purpose of accessing Canadian health resources was that which preceded the date of the marriage by many years. Furthermore, the unrelenting attempts by the spouse to obtain permanent residency status described above, including going so far as violating Canadian immigration law to obtain that objective, strongly support the conclusion that the spouse\u2019s primary purpose of the marriage was to acquire permanent residency status. [40] Conversely, the IAD concluded that the genuine marriage was only established over many years up to the time of the hearing. It is well recognized that the most significant time to consider the primary purpose of the marriage is before it occurs. Accordingly, the conclusion that the marriage was not genuine without the passage of time would provide little probative proof that the marriage was not entered into primarily for immigration purposes. [41] Moreover, with respect, I conclude that the decision of the Chief Justice Crampton in Depinder Kaur Gill v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1522 [the 2012 Gill decision] better represents the applicable law. The Chief Justice specifically rejected a similar submission made by the Applicant at paragraphs 28 and 29: [28] Ms. Kaur Gill submits that it was unreasonable for the IAD to find that her marriage with Mr. Gill was genuine, and then to conclude that she had not established that the primary purpose of the marriage was other than to gain status or privilege under the IRPA. [29] I disagree. A plain reading of section 4 of the Regulations reflects that these are two distinct tests. If a finding that a marriage is genuine precluded the possibility of a finding that the marriage was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA, the latter test would be superfluous. This would offend the presumption against statutory surplusage. (R v Proulx, 2000 SCC 5 (CanLII), at para 28, [2000] 1 SCR 61). [42] The Chief Justice\u2019s conclusion is confirmed by the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (\u201cRIAS\u201d) concerning the \u201cBad Faith Regulations\u201d, which explains why the section was amended to create a disjunctive test in the Canada Gazette, September 30, 2010: ... The intent of R4 is to protect the integrity of the immigration program by preventing individuals from using relationships of convenience or bad faith relationships to circumvent immigration law. Prior to this amendment, the provision stated that a foreign national would not be considered a spouse, a common-law partner, a conjugal partner or an adopted child of a person if the relationship was not genuine and was entered into primarily for immigration purposes. Under the previous provision, it was difficult to properly identify relationships of convenience. This is because R4, as it formerly read, specified two mandatory elements for determining \u201cbad faith\u201d relationships: (a) that a relationship is not genuine and (b) that it was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act. This led to a requirement that CIC be satisfied that both elements have not been met when refusing a case under this regulation and supporting that decision on appeal. However, a \u201cbad faith\u201d relationship is present when either of these related factors is apparent. [43] I therefore reject the contention that the IAD misapplied the applicable legal framework for assessing the primary purpose of the marriage. (2) The Board\u2019s decision is not constrained by a failure to consider significant evidence that the Applicant claims directly contradicted the primary purpose of the marriage being for immigration advantages [44] The Applicant contends that the IAD failed to consider evidence that contradicted the primary purpose of the marriage being for immigration purposes. This is reviewed on a standard of reasonableness. She refers to evidence in the two months prior to the marriage that purport to reveal the intentions and motivations of the couple. These include how the relationship started, the involvement of extended families, disclosure of his medical condition, moving in together before marriage, the holding of a wedding party attended by 80 members of the families, etc. [45] The IAD indicated that it had considered this evidence, but did not specifically mention it in its reasons. The principle in Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses' Union v. Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board), 2011 SCC 62 would apply in the circumstances of not requiring that all submissions be considered, particularly inasmuch as there is extensive probative evidence upon which the decision of bad faith purpose is based. The events referred to occurred in a short period of two months after they met. They are subject to crafting, with little or no commitment on the part of the Applicant apparent. Given the preceding immigration history and a search for other spouses that could sponsor him, which demonstrate a long-sought immigration advantage from gaining permanent residency status in Canada, there is no basis for the Court to intervene and rejects this submission. (3) The IAD is not constrained by any allegation that it did not reasonably rely on the Applicant\u2019s medical condition as a factor supporting its conclusion of an immigration purpose [46] The Applicant argues that the IAD was unreasonable by the weight it assigned to the Applicant\u2019s medical condition, which undermined the primary purpose of the marriage. The Court is being asked to reweigh the evidence when there is some evidence to support the finding of fact. [47] The submission is different from that originally advanced in the leave memorandum. The Applicant argued that IAD\u2019s assessment of the primary purpose of the marriage was discriminatory towards the Applicant\u2019s HIV status, which violated section 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, Part 1 of the Constitution Act, 1982, being Schedule B to the Canada Act 1982 (UK), 1982. The intervener has now taken up this issue, although no Charter argument is advanced. [48] Along somewhat the same lines of his previous discrimination argument, the Applicant submits that when an HIV positive individual marries a Canadian, access to better treatment will normally result, regardless of their true intentions for entering into the marriage. She therefore argues that access to treatment for HIV is a motivation connected to an individual\u2019s immutable characteristics, which the IDA should not employ to undermine the genuine intentions of the parties entering into the marriage. She stipulates that \u201c[t]his reasoning flows from the notion that such motivation will always exist for an individual with positive HIV status, even if the primary purpose of the marriage is for love.\u201d [49] The problem with the submission is that there is significant evidence of the spouse\u2019s predisposition to obtain an immigration status prior to any marriage for genuine purposes arising with the Applicant. Someone having an immutable characteristic does not detract from the fact that it may be the primary purpose for entering into the marriage for an immigration purpose, as the Applicant has acknowledged was a motivation for marriage. [50] I also note that access to medical resources is a corollary purpose that is external to the marriage relationship. It lacks mutuality and does not fit into the norm of what would constitute reciprocal exchanges such as love and compatibility that constitute a genuine marriage. Rather accessing medical resources is an external benefit that immigration provides by obtaining permanent resident status. [51] There is no basis to conclude a primary motivation prior to the relationship being entered into should became a secondary motivation upon meeting the Applicant, especially when the marriage conveniently provides an avenue long-sought by the spouse to obtain Canadian permanent residency. I find no unreasonableness in the decision by relying on circumstances prior to the marriage that are sufficiently probative to demonstrate its primary purpose and up to the occurrence of the marriage. It is not the Court\u2019s function to reweigh or second-guess this finding. [52] Alternatively, the Applicant asserts that if an \u201cimmutable motivation\u201d undermines the primary purpose of the marriage, the IAD must clearly explain that this motivation was the primary purpose of the marriage. This submission would relate to the requirement to provide intelligible, transparent and justified reasons. I reject the submission as I find the reasons to be thorough and detailed in explaining why the application was rejected. I am also not aware of any submission being made to IAD about \u201cimmutable characteristics\u201d, which might have entailed a specific comment on the point. [53] The examples in the case law cited by the Applicant have no application to this matter. The decision in Bautista v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 CanLII 26760 (FCA IRB) relates to an adoption where the adoptive parents in Canada are able to offer an improved standard of living and opportunities beyond the reach of the natural parents. The Court pointed out that the adoption of any child other than an orphan is almost always based on the premise that the adoptive parents will be able to provide something for the adopted child which the natural parents, for whatever reason, are unable or unwilling to provide. The case also contains no suggestion that the adopted child or parents acted in bad faith for an immigration purpose such as entering into a marriage followed by a sponsorship application by the spouse as a result of being unlawfully present in Canada. [54] Similarly, in the matter of Tamber v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 951, the Judge noted that \u201cmost individuals seeking to come to Canada are highly motivated to do so.\u201d Again, the case bears no resemblance to this matter. The main complaint in that decision was the failure of the Board to consider relevant evidence bearing directly on the issue at hand. More to the point, there was no previous litany of applications seeking to obtain permanent residency, nor any bad faith activity of the spouse found throughout his conduct in Canada. (4) The decision is not constrained as alleged that the Member rendered speculative findings there were unfounded and contradicted by the evidence on the record [55] For the most part, the submissions under this title are incidental to the primary facts relied upon by the IAD demonstrating a primary immigration purpose. They are mostly based upon the lengths that the Applicant went to in the different processes, refugee, PRRA and H&C, before finally trying the spousal\u2019s sponsorship route as a means to obtain Canadian residency, and the credibility issues relating to this aspect of the case. These in addition to the Applicant\u2019s admission that obtaining medication and treatment for his HIV condition was an overriding concern that formed the basis for the RAD\u2019s conclusion. The criticisms of these findings in her decision are unfounded, while they logically and reasonably support the reasonableness of the decision. (a) Misapprehending evidence regarding the Applicant\u2019s family\u2019s involvement in the introduction of the couple [56] Misapprehending evidence, if proven and serious, may be grounds to set aside a finding of fact that, if overriding, could be sufficient to set aside the decision. The misapprehension of evidence is an error that is plainly seen. However, in no manner could what appears to be an incorrect naming of a person who introduced the couple be considered an overriding error rendering the decision unreasonable. [57] The Applicant submits that this mistake is \u201cone of the main reasons for concluding the primary purpose of the marriage was to obtain immigration status.\u201d A claim as to who introduced the couple in the first instance is such a minor matter that to declare it as one of the main reasons for rejecting the application is a serious exaggeration and untenable submission. There is almost no connexion between the misapprehension about how the couple met at paragraph 34 of the decision, and the IAD\u2019s findings eight paragraphs later at paragraph 42 setting out the various reasons for dismissing the application. (b) The adverse credibility findings are reasonable concerning the Applicant\u2019s decision to make a false refugee claim, thereafter delaying its withdrawal and subsequently advancing a sponsorship application when illegally in Canada, all allegedly justified as being based on lawyers\u2019 advice [58] These issues concern factual findings relating to the Applicant\u2019s credibility. They relate to the weighing of evidence and are not subject to being overturned if supported by some evidence, particularly given the respect required to be given to the decision by the fact that the Board heard viva voce evidence. I find that the IAD\u2019s conclusion is supported by considerable evidence and no reviewable error is demonstrated. [59] The spouse claims that he filed his refugee claim in the first instance based upon the advice of a lawyer when first arriving to Canada. He states that the lawyer advised him to make a refugee claim claiming that his life was at risk in India, and that everything would \u201cnormalize.\u201d He also blamed his lawyer who advised him that he could not withdraw his refugee application except at the hearing. In the third instance, he alleges having relied upon his lawyer\u2019s evidence that he should marry the Applicant and file a sponsorship application, which would prevent his removal, and which he acknowledges turns out to be erroneous. [60] Any claim by witnesses that justifies their wrongful or unlawful conduct based upon legal advice has little or no probative value without corroboration in the form of putting the lawyer on notice in order to provide an opportunity for the person to defend attacks on his or her professional reputation. The IAD reasonably concluded that there was no persuasive reason given to support reliance upon lawyer\u2019s advice in the first two instances. This is supported by some evidence. For the third circumstance of an alleged lawyer-driven behaviour, the Member concluded that the Applicant and spouse had decided to marry prior to obtaining the legal advice. Expressed in this fashion, the Applicant and spouse claim that the IAD made a speculative adverse inference pertaining to their credibility. [61] In the first two instances, the adverse credibility findings were supported by the conclusion that there is no persuasive evidence justifying reliance on the lawyers. It is not clear why the same reasoning did not apply with respect to the third instance, except perhaps that she found the Applicant to be credible and she supported the spouse\u2019s story. [62] In any event, I have indicated on several occasions that the case law referred to that adverse credibility findings are permissible only in the clearest of cases and must be made based on clear evidence and a clear rationalization process is not good law. The Applicant referred to Santos v Canada (MCI), 2004 FC 937, which decision relates back to that of Valtchev v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCT 776, [2001] FCJ No. 1131 (TD) at para 7 [Valtchev]. I have criticized Valtchev as being entirely erroneous from every perspective, the most extensive reasons being provided in my recent decision in Kallab v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 706, at paras 133 to 157 [Kallab]. With respect, such an evidentiary rule, with its resulting effect on the standard of review rule of factual findings, does not exist in any other jurisdiction in Canada. Even the term \u201cimplausibility\u201d is confusing and to my knowledge not used to describe inferences in any other Canadian jurisdiction. The appropriate term for an unreasonable inference would be an \u201cimprobability\u201d, as Canadian evidence regimes only work with probabilities, unless no other option exists. [63] All of this reasoning aside, Valtchev is also irreconcilable with the prescriptions in Vavilov at paragraphs 126 and 127 applying to factual findings, including inferential and credibility findings described above, the most patent being the lack of deference owed credibility factual findings of administrative decision makers. [64] In this matter, the foundational facts that support the inference in question reside in the insufficiency of corroborating evidence regarding the alleged lawyer\u2019s advice, as described above. Moreover, given the training, professionalism and general high standards of Ontario lawyers, it is not speculative to suggest that it is highly unlikely that members of the Ontario bar would provide such erroneous advice, unless somehow misled about the spouse illegally residing in Canada. [65] With respect to the principle in Maldonado v MEI, [1980] 2 FC 302 (CA) [Maldonado] that sworn statements carry a presumption of truthfulness, the rule only applies in refugee proceedings, although it is cited in many other circumstances, including those involving purely paper processes. Its true function is to excuse a refugee claimant from having to corroborate sworn testimony. In refugee matters, the presumption may be justified by circumstances of flight and an uncooperative State which both make obtaining corroborative evidence highly problematic. [66] Nonetheless, I have raised concerns in Kallab regarding the overreach of Maldonado. There is no general rule presuming the testimony of a witness to be truthful(R v Thain (2009), 243 CCC (3d) 230 at para 32. (Ont CA)). Concerns include whether it fetters the RPD\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to section 170(h) of the IRPA that establishes the Board\u2019s authority to \u201creceive and base a decision on evidence that is adduced in the proceedings and considered credible or trustworthy in the circumstances.\u201d I further concluded that Maldonado should be limited to credibility issues, and not apply to the second factor of \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d stated in section 170(h) of the Act to avoid fettering issues. Rule 11 of the RPD Rules also requires corroboration. Finally, I submitted that the preferred corroboration principle should be similar to \u201cbenefit of the doubt rule\u201d in the UNCHR Handbook and Guidelines on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status under the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, Reissued Geneva, December 2011, at paragraphs 203 to 205. It provides that only if the refugee claimant has demonstrated having made a genuine effort to substantiate the sworn statement, should the benefit of the doubt of its truthfulness be accepted, as opposed to being presumed. (c) The findings that the Applicant\u2019s proposal pressured the spouse to agree to the marriage and that they were not ready to get married are reasonable [67] The Applicant argues that the finding of fact that he pressured spouse into the marriage is speculative and not supported by the record. This is a fact assessment issue related to the sufficiency of the evidence and subject to the reasonableness standard. She sets out passages from the evidence that the Court is requested to review to determine whether the fact is supported by some evidence. It includes one statement by the spouse as follows: Okay. Aman had asked me do you want to marry me, tell me yes or no. If not, then I have to go to India will stop because the date was in October. On fourth of October. If you say no, then I will go to India. Then if you say yes then we will get married. [68] This evidence is sufficient to support a conclusion that the Applicant pressured the spouse to either marry him or he would leave. [69] I do not find the inference speculative that the history of failed marriages would lead the couple to be \u201cmore cautious about jumping into their second and third marriages respectively\u201d, particularly with a child involved. An inference is drawn from the uniformity of prior human experience based upon foundational facts (R. v Munoz, 86 OR (3d) 134, 2006 CanLII 3269 (ON SC) at para 23). Here the foundational facts are that between the two spouses, they have experienced five failed marriages. [70] The adage \u201conce burned, twice shy\u201d expresses a common sense rule based on prior human experience that would apply in these circumstances. Marriages involve serious consequences. It is not speculation that persons who have been the subject of five failed marriages between them, including one involving a child, would approach their next marriage with some degree of caution, as opposed to marrying two months after first meeting. It is a reasonable inference that these foundational facts support a conclusion, along with the extensive other evidence referred to by the IDA, that the marriage was not originally genuine and was entered into by the Applicant for an immigration purpose. C. The reasonableness of the decision is not constrained by the disjunctive element of subsection 4(1) of the IRPR being ultra viries its enabling statute, specifically section 3(1)(d) of the IRPA as the Court refuses to hear the issue raised the first time at the further memorandum of argument stage which lacks little strength [71] In her further memorandum, the Applicant argues that s. 4(1) of the Regulations is ultra vires the enabling statute, as that section prohibits sponsorship of genuine spouses contrary to the aims and objectives of the IRPA, namely s. 3(1)(d), \u201cto see that families are reunited in Canada.\u201d The Applicant submits that the operation of the disjunctive test of s. 4(1) of the Regulations in the case at bar results in an almost certain permanent separation of genuine spouses and a separation between a young Canadian child and his stepfather, which is contrary to the stated objective of family reunification in the IRPA. Accordingly, s. 4 of the Regulations ought to be inoperative. [72] The Respondent submits that the Court should refuse to hear the matter as its jurisprudence is consistent in declining to hear new arguments raised the first time at the further memorandum of argument stage: Aguirre Garcia v Canada (M.C.I.), 2006 FC 645 (CanLII); See also Arora v Canada (M.C.I.), [2001] F.C.J. No. 24 at para 9. While there is a discretion to consider new issues, the Respondent argues that in these circumstances all the facts and matters relevant to the new issue or issues were known to the Applicant at the time of the application for leave and the file perfected, such that the new issue could have been raised on a timely basis at the leave stage (Al Mansuri v. MPSEP & Solicitor General, 2007 FC 22 (CanLII), 2007 FC 22 at para 12). [73] Moreover, the Respondent argues that there is little strength to the Applicant\u2019s argument, inasmuch as the jurisprudence of the Court as already found that it is not ultra vires (Singh v M.C.I., 2014 FC 1077, at para. 28; Burton v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 345 (CanLII), at paras. 32-34 [Burton]). [74] I agree that the Court should decline to hear this new argument. In particular, I am in agreement with reasoning of my colleague Justice McDonald in Burton at paragraph 33, as follows, with my emphasis: [33] While I acknowledge the Court in Singh went on to certify a question, I am in agreement with its analysis and am moreover bound by the Federal Court of Appeal authorities upon which the Court relied: Azizi v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FCA 406 (CanLII) at paras 27-32; dela Fuente v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FCA 186 (CanLII)at para 48. As the Federal Court of Appeal noted in Azizi, the objective of family reunification must be considered in light of the objective of maintaining the integrity of the immigration system. The proposed questions do not transcend the interests of the parties. [75] The objective of maintaining the integrity of the immigration system is even more significant in this matter where the spouse of the Applicant has acted in flagrant disregard for Canadian immigration laws and benefited by doing so in being able to have the within sponsorship application brought forward as a result. [76] I therefore decline to entertain this new issue. D. The reasonableness of the decision is not constrained by perpetuating HIV-related stigma by relying on discriminatory stereotypes of people living with HIV [77] The HIV and AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario (\u201cHALCO\u201c or the Intervener) obtained leave to intervene in this matter to provide submissions with respect to supporting HIV and AIDS persons in protecting their interests in this matter where relevant. [78] The Intervener\u2019s overall submission is that the IAD\u2019s decision perpetuates HIV-related stigma by relying on discriminatory stereotypes of people living with HIV. The issue at hand as described by the Respondent, which I accept, is whether the Intervener has demonstrated that the IAD\u2019s treatment of the spouse\u2019s HIV status relied on discriminatory stereotypes of people living with HIV. I disagree. [79] I repeat my initial remarks that the facts in this matter do not permit much scope for any positive submission on behalf of the Applicant and particularly the spouse. Long before the spouse contemplated any marriage with the Applicant, he demonstrated in the most probative fashion possible, that his singular motivation throughout was to find some way to live in Canada permanently, even to the point of flagrantly violating Canadian immigration law as a means to do so. His HIV status is irrelevant and cannot justify or excuse this behaviour. [80] Even were these not the facts facing the Applicant and intervener, there is no basis to conclude that the spouse was stigmatized and suffered discrimination in the course of these proceedings. These are not issues of discriminatory public services or treatment by other citizens and entities in Canada. Specialized decision-makers knowledgeable of factors that are relevant to genuine marriages and their primary purposes have performed their duties to implement the law, which in these limited circumstances is to ensure that there is no abuse of marriages or similar intended long-term relationships, when the purpose is to gain immigration advantages, principally by attaining Canadian permanent resident status. [81] Discrimination is generally understood to be some form of prejudicial treatment applied to the discriminated person because of his or her specific characteristic that is not applied to others in the specific circumstances where it is being alleged. Section 4(1) of the Regulation is generic in its requirements such that it provides little scope for discrimination. All sponsored spouses must demonstrate that the primary purpose of the marriage is not for acquiring any status or immigration privilege and the marriage is genuine. Purpose and motivation are qualities shared by all spouses with no inherent bias or distinction built into the provisions based upon the specific characteristics or intrinsic differences between applicants and spouses. [82] The Applicant\u2019s argument is that the IAD\u2019s decision creates a discriminatory evidentiary burden for people living with HIV to demonstrate that their marriages to Canadian citizens have not been entered into primarily for immigration purposes, in addition to demonstrating that their marriages are genuine, although the latter issue is not relevant in this matter. The argument, as I understand it, is that because the spouse living with HIV has a need for lifesaving treatment obtained in Canada, as accepted by the Member, his primary purpose will be assessed differently from other spouses without HIV, but who are suffering equally significant health issues such as cancer. There is no basis to differentiate the situations in terms of the primary purpose of the marriage being that of gaining an immigration advantage of medical treatment. [83] While there may be compassionate sympathy for persons with serious health problems, it is nonetheless fair to conclude that Section 4(1) of the Regulation was created with this type of situation in mind as one of many to ensure that obtaining superior health services is not the primary purpose of the marriage from the sponsored spouse\u2019s perspective. [84] There is no question that person suffering HIV are often stigmatized and discriminated against and that appropriate measures should be taken where this results in their different and prejudicial treatment. But Section 4(1) of the Regulation was not drafted with the purpose of favouring discriminated persons to have their health concerns considered differentially to health concerns of similar severity of other persons. All that they can ask is to be treated in the same manner vis-\u00e0-vis comparable health issues as everyone else. [85] However, I agree with the Applicant\u2019s complaint that persons questioning a sponsoring spouse about why he or she would accept the responsibility of caring for someone with AIDS, should emphasize that the question is directed at having to care for anyone with a serious health problem, and not reflecting that the cause of health problem being AIDS. However, I do not conclude that this line of questioning has had any impact on the outcome of the decision. [86] With regard to other points raised by the Intervener, I disagree with her submissions concerning aspects of the IAD\u2019s assessment of evidence. An example is the Intervener\u2019s criticism of the Member\u2019s reliance upon objective evidence detailing the spouse\u2019s misconduct prior to the marriage that the intervener complains \u201coutweighed his sworn testimony\u201d and \u201cis presumed to be true.\u201d This appears to be a reference to the principal in Maldonado, which I have pointed out has no application outside of refugee claims. The Intervener\u2019s submission also ignores the fact that there were serious adverse credibility problems encountered by the spouse, not to mention his \u201cflagrant disregard for Canada process immigration laws\u201d. The spouse has demonstrated his bad faith and a lack of clean hands by intentionally violating Canadian immigration law for the purpose of obtaining permanent residency status, which seriously detracts from his credibility on similar matters and is very probative evidence of a primary purpose of gaining an immigration advantage whatever the means. VI. Certified questions [87] The Applicant proposed questions for certification on appeal. I find no grounds to do so because the questions do not satisfy the requirements of s. 74(d) of the IRPA according to the test set out in Liyanagamage v Canada (Secretary of State) (1994), 176 NR 4 and recently affirmed in Zhang v Canada (MCI), 2013 FCA 168 at para 9, and Zazai v Canada (MCI), 2004 FCA 89 at para 11. In a nutshell, a certified question must be (i) determinative of the appeal and (ii) one which transcends the interests of the immediate parties to the litigation and contemplates issues of broad significance or general application, sometimes stated as \u201ca serious issue of general importance.\u201d [88] The Applicant proposes the following three questions: 1. How is the assessment of the primary purpose of marriage under subsection 4(1) of the Regulations impacted, when a purpose is connected to an individual\u2019s immutable characteristic such as disability, sexual-orientation, race and other similar grounds? 2. Is the disjunctive element of subsection 4(1) of the IRPR ultra vires the enabling statute, the IRPA, because subsection 4(1) would prohibit the sponsorship of a spouse when the marriage was found to be entered into primarily for the purpose of gaining status, notwithstanding a finding that the marriage always was or subsequently became genuine, and would therefore frustrate the aims and objectives of the Act, in particular section 3(1)(d), \u201cto see that families are reunited in Canada?\u201d 3. In assessing the primary purpose of marriage under section 4(1) the Regulation, what factors are indicia of the primary purpose as opposed to collateral purposes? [89] I find that all three questions tend to be limited by their factual underpinning, and for the first and third questions, not being serious ones of general importance, being related very much to the factual assessments under pinning them. [90] With respect to the first question, any \u201cimmutable characteristic\u201d of the individual relating to HIV as the source of the immigration benefit he would obtain from access to Canadian health services, this is no different than a similar health need of a foreign national claimant who suffers from some other malady, such as cancer, and would similarly obtain an immigration benefit from access to Canadian health services. [91] With respect to the second question, although a similar question was certified in the matter of Singh, I am in agreement with the reasoning in Burton referred to above. In particular, reliance upon the Federal Court of Appeal decisions in terms of protecting the integrity of Canada\u2019s immigration regime figures strongly this matter, where there are additional bad-faith circumstances relating to Applicant\u2019s conduct described above. [92] With respect to the Applicant\u2019s third question pertaining to assessment factors that distinguish the primary immigration purpose from a secondary purpose, this is a contextual factual determination, and it is not possible to state a general rule in their application. As already indicated, the question certainly as framed would not be determinative of the outcome, besides which it does not raise a serious issue of general importance. VII. Conclusion [93] The Court concludes that the decision is reasonable being justified based both on its internally coherent transparent and intelligible reasoning and in light of the legal and factual constraints that bear on the decision. Accordingly the application is dismissed with no questions certified for appeal. JUDGMENT IN IMM-2069-19 The Application is dismissed.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200122 Docket: IMM-2520-19 Citation: 2020 FC 99 Toronto, Ontario, January 22, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice Diner BETWEEN: GUSTAVO EVIEL RENDON SEGOVIA MARCELA NALLELY SALAZAR OCHOA EDWIN EVIEL RENDON SALAZAR EDSON GABRIEL RENDON SALAZAR Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] In this judicial review, the Applicants, a family of four from Mexico, challenge the refusal of their refugee claim appeal. After having read their submissions, and then upon hearing oral arguments, Applicants\u2019 counsel persuaded me that reviewable errors occurred, which require me to send this appeal back to the tribunal for redetermination. I advised the parties that written reasons would follow. These are the reasons promised. [2] The Principal Applicant, who was employed as a unionized driver, claims that members of the Los Zetas drug cartel: kidnapped him in April 2017, drove him to an ATM and extorted from him the maximum daily withdrawal; kidnapped him again in May 2017, detaining and beating him for three days, and demanded a significant monthly sum after showing pictures of his wife and children; and then approached him on three occasions in June 2017, asking for said money. As the Principal Applicant did not have the funds that he claims Los Zetas asked of him, the family fled to Canada shortly afterwards, claiming refugee protection on August 1, 2017. [3] The Refugee Protection Division [RPD] dismissed the claim under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [Act], because nothing on the record raised a nexus between the alleged harm suffered and a Convention ground. Under subsection 97(1), the RPD found the Applicants had internal flight alternatives [IFAs] in Cancun, Hermosillo, and La Paz. The RPD found that the Applicants would not face a risk of harm, particularly in Cancun, as the facts asserted were that the assailants operated as a group, had weapons, drove a big car, and bribed the police, but did not necessarily indicate that the assailants belonged to a cartel or were motivated to locate the Applicants. Rather, the RPD found the Applicants were targeted due to a perception of wealth and thus common victims of crime, and they could move to avoid future extortion. The RPD deemed the IFAs reasonable alternatives given the adult Applicants\u2019 professional skills, assets, language ability and cultural heritage, including their religion (Catholic). II. Decision under Review [4] On March 29, 2019, the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD or tribunal] confirmed the RPD\u2019s decision, and it is the RAD decision [Decision] now under review. [5] The Applicants submitted eleven new pieces of evidence to the RAD. Five of these were submitted with the appeal record. Six were submitted after the appeal\u2019s perfection. Claimants who seek to submit evidence after an appeal\u2019s perfection should do so in accordance with Rule 29 of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules, SOR/2012-257 [Rules]. Applicants\u2019 then-counsel did not comply with this rule. Nonetheless, the RAD considered all eleven documents, admitting two letters of support from the Principal Applicant\u2019s: (a) mother, who noted that unknown people driving vans and carrying guns had been asking after the Principal Applicant, and that one of his uncles had disappeared, and (b) brother-in-law, a police officer in Mexico, who named Los Zetas as the cartel to which the assailants belong. [6] The RAD rejected the other pieces of evidence (see a listing of these documents at Appendix A). The RAD found that it had sufficient information to complete the appeal without an oral hearing under subsection 110(6) of the Act. [7] The RAD held that the only evidence produced to demonstrate that the assailants belong to Los Zetas was his brother-in-law\u2019s letter, but gave it little weight, stating it did not constitute convincing evidence that the assailants belong to Los Zetas. The RAD further agreed with the RPD\u2019s finding on the section 96 nexus (extortion based on perceived wealth rather than a Convention ground) as well as a lack of section 97 risk, noting that the Applicants provided \u201cno rebuttal of the IFA in the Memorandum.\u201d III. Analysis [8] The Applicants cite errors in the RAD\u2019s assessment of evidence (both admitted and excluded), and consequently in the RAD\u2019s IFA analysis. As these issues relate to the merits of an administrative decision, they will be reviewed for reasonableness, since that presumption has neither been rebutted by a statutory nor rule of law exemption (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para 23 [Vavilov]). [9] The Applicants also claim procedural unfairness due to the representation by their counsel (an immigration consultant) before the tribunal. This third issue does not challenge the merits of the Decision, but instead asks whether the process was fair. In Vavilov, the Supreme Court appeared to leave the prior jurisprudence on this point unchanged, meaning correctness review still applies to breaches of procedural fairness (Vavilov at para 23; Mission Institution v Khela, 2014 SCC 24 at para 79; Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at para 54). A. The RAD erred in analyzing the evidence and the IFAs [10] The Applicants argue that the RAD unreasonably assessed the letters from the Principal Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law (an active member of the Mexican Federal Police) and mother, and that it unreasonably excluded his mother\u2019s police complaint and the psychological assessment of the minor Applicant. The latter, they say, also led to an incomplete assessment of the IFA. (1) Analysis of Evidence [11] I agree with the Applicants that the RAD erred in its assessment of the letters from the Principal Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law and mother. Both letters contain allegations of Los Zetas involvement in the kidnappings, a central issue of the appeal. The RAD\u2019s analysis regarding the letter from the Principal Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law was contained in the following paragraph: As there has been insufficient evidence adduced to convince me that the agents of harm are members of Los Zetas, the only evidence of Zeta involvement, which consists of a letter of support by the principal Appellant\u2019s brother-in-law, carries little weight and certainly not sufficient weight to convince me of the Zetas\u2019 involvement in this crime against the principal Appellant. [12] Regarding the mother\u2019s letter, the RAD found that certain parts of the letter provided new information \u2013 namely that unknown armed people driving in vans were asking for her son\u2019s whereabouts, and that her brother had disappeared. When deciding to admit this document, the RAD stated that it would \u201cassess the weight it deserves later,\u201d but made no further mention of it. [13] This is problematic. I recognize that the RAD may have had a reasonable basis for assigning little weight to this evidence for various reasons. Perhaps it was thinking that the letters were self-serving (Fadiga v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1157 at para 14). Or perhaps the tribunal felt they otherwise lacked credibility. However, the RAD failed to provide any explanation for assigning the brother-in-law\u2019s letter little weight and, in the case of the mother\u2019s letter, failed to provide any assessment of weight that it had promised. As a result, the Court cannot know what the tribunal thought about the letter and how it impacted the Decision. Thus, the RAD provided no means for this Court to determine whether the outcome was reached on a proper basis. [14] In my view, the RAD\u2019s determination of the weight it attributed to these letters was essential to the outcome, because there was little to no other corroborating evidence. If the RAD had accepted that Los Zetas \u2013 a criminal organization with wide reach \u2013 had targeted the Principal Applicant, this may have impacted a central question of the appeal, namely, whether the proposed IFAs were indeed safe. As the Supreme Court recently held, where \u201ca decision maker\u2019s rationale for an essential element of the decision is not addressed in the reasons and cannot be inferred from the record, the decision will generally fail to meet the requisite standard of justification, transparency and intelligibility\u201d (Vavilov at para 98). [15] For a similar reason, I also agree with the Applicants that the RAD unreasonably rejected the psychological assessment of one of the minor Applicants on the basis that it was not relevant. This report noted an intellectual disability, in that his \u201ccognitive and academic functioning is significantly delayed relative to same-aged peers,\u201d and that he \u201cwould benefit from consistent exposure to an education setting where specialized accommodations can be provided.\u201d [16] The RAD should have provided reasons to dismiss this evidence (e.g. for non-compliance with the Rules). Non-relevance, however, was an unreasonable ground on which to reject the evidence, because the report was relevant to the IFAs, in terms of potential hardship an applicant will face in those cities and, ultimately, whether those IFAs are reasonable (Iyere v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 67 at para 52 [Iyere]). Again, Vavilov is instructive, when the majority states \u201c[e]ven if the outcome of the decision could be reasonable under different circumstances, it is not open to a reviewing court to disregard the flawed basis for a decision and substitute its own justification for the outcome\u201d (at para 96). [17] The unreasonable missteps made in the analysis of the documents described above are, in my view, sufficient to return the matter to the tribunal. However, I will briefly discuss the other issues raised for the sake of completeness. (2) Analysis of IFA [18] My conclusion that the RAD wrongly failed to consider the psychological report gives rise to an error in the IFA analysis, and as such is related to the first error. Specifically, after stating that counsel had made no argument to rebut the proposed IFAs (and this in turn is related to the procedural fairness issue regarding the conduct of counsel as discussed below), the RAD determined that the Applicants adduced insufficient evidence to prove that Los Zetas were the agents of harm when it wrote: As the RPD found that there were multiple possible IFAs, including Cancun, and that those IFAs were reasonable and safe and no argument has been made to rebut the RPD\u2019s finding, I concur with the RPD and find that the Appellants have multiple IFAs in Mexico. [19] The two-pronged test for assessing an IFA is well established: the RAD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that (1) there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the IFA; and (2) conditions in the IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable for the claimant to seek refuge there (Iyere at para 30; Figueroa v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 521 at para 51 [Figueroa]). [20] Here, the RAD simply concurred with the RPD on the availability of the IFAs on the basis that the RPD found the \u201cIFAs were reasonable and safe and no argument has been made to rebut\u201d this finding. Certainly, the RAD, after conducting its own IFA analysis, may arrive at the same conclusion as the RPD. But here, the RAD could not undertake an analysis under the second prong of the test to determine whether the IFAs are reasonable, given that it did not have key evidence before it: the psychological evidence provided a basis upon which the RAD should have considered the second part of the test, and should not have simply parroted the RPD, as that evidence post-dated the RPD decision. B. Counsel\u2019s incompetence resulted in a breach of procedural fairness [21] The immigration consultant who acted as \u201ccounsel\u201d for the Applicants before the RAD should have known IFA was a central issue in the appeal: after all, the RPD deemed it to be the determinative issue. There is no doubt that the immigration consultant should have addressed the IFA in written submissions to the RAD. [22] This Court has stated that in proceedings under the Act, the incompetence of counsel will only constitute a breach of natural justice in \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d (Memari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 1196 at para 36 [Memari]). To demonstrate that the incompetence of counsel amounted to a breach of procedural fairness, applicants must establish that each element of a tripartite test is met, namely that (i) prior counsel\u2019s acts or omissions constituted incompetence; (ii) a miscarriage of justice resulted in the sense that, but for the alleged conduct, there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different; and (iii) the representative was given a reasonable opportunity to respond (Guadron v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1092 at para 11 [Guadron]). However, one begins with a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct fell within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance (R v GDB, 2000 SCC 22 at paras 26-27 [GDB]). [23] In the proceedings before the RAD, the only argument that the Applicants\u2019 immigration consultant advanced on the issue of IFA was the following statement that is both unintelligible, and also fails to address or challenge the key RPD findings regarding the IFAs: In his decision, the Board Member states that the Applicant failed to produce sufficient evidence to convince him that he had approached the police or any other government agency that adequate state protection would not reasonably in Mexico [sic]. [24] In the Decision, the RAD made a point of criticizing this deficiency, when it found \u201c[a]s there has been no rebuttal of the IFA in the Memorandum, I must consider that there is no argument against the proposed IFAs\u201d (emphasis added). Then, in its decision to dismiss the appeal, the RAD \u2013 like the RPD \u2013 noted that the IFA was determinative. [25] In short, there is little doubt that, under the first arm of the tripartite test set out in Guadron, failing to make submissions on the determinative issue in a decision \u2013 when appealing the merits of that decision \u2013 amounts to pure incompetence. This is particularly the case when the appellate tribunal reminds the representative of the key issue in the decision being challenged, as occurred here. Put otherwise, this is not a situation where the immigration consultant\u2019s actions would be covered by the usual presumption of a \u201cwide range of reasonable professional assistance\u201d with the benefit and \u201cwisdom of hindsight\u201d (GDB at para 27). This was not, for instance, an ex post facto criticism of the chosen litigation strategy \u2013 of which others existed \u2013 and where the chosen option proved unsuccessful, only to be criticized by Monday-morning quarterbacks with twenty-twenty hindsight. [26] The second and third components of the tripartite test are also met. I will, however, address them in reverse order, because some of the responses of the immigration consultant to the allegations (the third part of the test), help to inform the second \u2013 that a miscarriage of justice occurred in these circumstances because there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different but for the incompetence. [27] Applicants\u2019 counsel before this Court followed the procedures set out in the March 7, 2014 protocol entitled Re: Allegations Against Counsel or Other Authorized Representative in Citizenship, Immigration and Protected Person Cases before the Federal Court. In particular, Applicants\u2019 current counsel notified the immigration consultant in writing of the allegations and the possibility of them being raised on judicial review, and provided the consultant an opportunity to respond. The response is included in the record for this judicial review, and the allegations are fully canvassed in the pleadings before this Court. This satisfied the Guadron notice requirement. [28] In the response to the Applicants\u2019 current counsel, the immigration consultant stated that \u201cthe attached articles suggest that criminal organizations and their smaller branches and allies are located all over Mexico.\u201d However, this does not explain the lack of submissions made on the IFA. It also does not explain the non-compliance with the Rules with respect to the new evidence presented (see Annex A). [29] In short, the Applicants\u2019 counsel for this judicial review maintains that key evidence was missed and unaddressed regarding both (i) the risks they faced and will face from Los Zetas, particularly with respect to the IFAs, and (ii) the reasonability of such IFA for their son. [30] I agree. First, the former immigration consultant failed to comply with the tribunal\u2019s Rules in submitting evidence. Second, once the RAD nonetheless agreed to consider the late evidence, the immigration consultant failed to address key evidence regarding the determinative issue (IFA). Third, the immigration consultant failed to provide updated evidence regarding the risks of Los Zetas operating in the three named IFAs (which were properly included by current counsel in the judicial review record, even though they were not put before the RAD, precisely because of the procedural fairness allegations). [31] These acts and omissions cumulatively satisfy the burden to establish that a miscarriage of justice resulted from the immigration consultant\u2019s incompetence (Memari at paras 38-39 and 64), in the sense that but for the alleged conduct, there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different. [32] This was made abundantly clear from the RAD member\u2019s criticism of the lack of any argument on IFA, when he reasoned that since the immigration consultant did not rebut the IFA, \u201cI must consider that there is no argument against the proposed IFAs.\u201d Again, IFA was the determinative issue before the RPD, and it became the determinative issue once again in the RAD Decision under review. As this Court has previously found, the Board would not have sent this message if it did not feel that a serious omission had occurred (Mcintyre v Candada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1351 at para 37). [33] As the (i) cumulative effects of counsel\u2019s failures amounted to incompetent conduct, (ii) incompetent conduct resulted in a miscarriage of justice, and (iii) the immigration consultant had the opportunity to fully explain her perspective, I find that a breach of procedural fairness occurred in the Decision under review. IV. Conclusion [34] The RAD erred in its assessment of the evidence by failing to explain why it attributed little weight to evidence that spoke to a significant issue on appeal. It also erred in rejecting the psychological assessment on the basis that it was irrelevant, when it was indeed relevant to the IFA analysis. This error led to another, in that the RAD failed to engage in the second prong of the IFA analysis. Given that the IFAs were determinative, these shortcomings render the Decision unreasonable in that the Decision was neither justified nor transparent in relation to both its factual and legal constraints (Vavilov at para 99). The incompetent representation of their immigration consultant before the RAD and resulting breach of procedural fairness also vitiates the Decision. As a result, I will grant this application for judicial review, and return the appeal to the RAD for redetermination. JUDGMENT in IMM-2520-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: This application for judicial review is granted. The matter is returned to the Refugee Appeal Division for redetermination by a different panel. No questions for certification were argued, and I agree none arise. There is no award as to costs. \"Alan S.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200117 Docket: IMM-6388-18 Citation: 2020 FC 63 Ottawa, Ontario, January 17, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice James W. O'Reilly BETWEEN: FREDWRIC HAKIZIMANA MARIE ROSE NIYONZIMA Applicants and CANADA (PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS) Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] The applicants, Mr Frederic Hakizimana and Marie Rose Niyonzima, are citizens of Burundi and members of the Tutsi minority. In 2015, after participating in a protest against the President of Burundi, the applicants feared reprisals from the Burundi government and fled first to Rwanda, and then to Uganda, where they were granted asylum. They later travelled to the United States and then to Canada, arriving on foot in 2018. They sought, and were refused, refugee status here. [2] An immigration officer found the applicants ineligible for refugee protection in Canada because they had already been granted asylum in another country, Uganda. The officer\u2019s decision was subsequently reversed and the applicants were scheduled to appear before a panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board to prosecute their claims. However, before a hearing was held, the Board informed the applicants that on November 30, 2018, an officer with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) had determined that they were, indeed, ineligible for refugee protection. The Board closed their file. [3] The applicants argue that the CBSA officer misapplied the ineligibility rule in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, s 101(1)(d) [IRPA] (see Annex). They say that the officer should not have found them ineligible on the basis of their refugee status in Uganda given their fear of persecution there. Further, they submit that the officer treated them unfairly by failing to give them an opportunity to address the officer\u2019s concerns. They ask me to quash the officer\u2019s decision and order another officer to consider the issue of ineligibility. [4] I disagree with the applicants that the CBSA officer misinterpreted s 101(1)(d). That provision does apply to persons who fear persecution in the country where they have refugee status. There are means of protecting persons in the applicants\u2019 circumstances other than granting them refugee status. Further, the applicants were not treated unfairly by the officer. [5] There are two issues: Did the officer misinterpret s 101(1)(d) of IRPA? Did the officer treat the applicants unfairly? II. The Legal Framework [6] IRPA provides that claimants for refugee protection are ineligible if they have been granted refugee status in another country and \u201ccan be sent or returned to that country\u201d. Accordingly, there are two criteria for ineligibility \u2013 claimants must have refugee status in another country, and there must be an ability to send or return them there. [7] This provision has been interpreted to mean that persons will be ineligible for refugee protection in Canada if they have refugee status in another country, they can physically be returned there, and they can legally enter that country (Farah v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 292; Jekula v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 1 FC 266 (aff\u2019d without reasons [2000] FCJ No 1956 (Fed CA)); Kaberuka v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1995] 3 FC 252). The fact that these persons may face persecution in the place where they have refugee status does not make them eligible for refugee protection in Canada. The question of whether Canada would, in sending persons to the country where they have refugee status, be in violation of its obligations under the Refugee Convention or the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms does not arise at the stage where eligibility for refugee status is considered. [8] There is a related issue of whether persons ineligible for refugee protection are, nonetheless, entitled to a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) where the risk of persecution in the state where they have refugee status can be evaluated. [9] IRPA states that persons who have been granted protection by Canada, or by another country to which they can be returned, cannot be removed from Canada to a place where they would be at risk of persecution or of torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment (s 115(1)). This is commonly referred to as the principle of non-refoulement. It appears to cover persons, such as the applicants, who are ineligible to claim refugee protection in Canada because they have refugee status in another country to which they can be returned. [10] However, IRPA goes on to provide that persons who fall within s 115(1) cannot apply for a PRRA (s 112(1)). It follows that persons who are ineligible for refugee protection in Canada on the basis that they have refugee status in another country may not be eligible for a PRRA. At the same time, they cannot be returned to the country where they fear persecution. III. Did the officer misinterpret s 101(1)(d)? [11] The parties disagree on the standard of review that applies to this question. The applicants say that I can overturn the officer\u2019s decision if it was incorrect. The Minister says that I can intervene only if I find the officer\u2019s conclusion to be unreasonable. [12] I agree with the Minister on this point. The officer was interpreting provisions of a statute within the officer\u2019s area of expertise. I would apply a standard of unreasonableness to the officer\u2019s analysis (Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 SCC 31 at paras 27-28). This conclusion is reinforced by the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in which the Court held that the presumptive standard of review is reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para 23). [13] The applicants submit that the officer\u2019s interpretation of s 101(1)(d) was unreasonable because it conflicts with Canada\u2019s obligations not to send persons back to countries where they have a well-founded fear of persecution. [14] I disagree. The officer\u2019s decision was reasonable based on the wording of s 101(1)(d) and the case law cited above. Further, according to internal governmental guidelines, the applicants are entitled to receive an assessment of their risk in Uganda before being removed from Canada. The fact that the applicants are ineligible for refugee status does not mean that Canada has failed to discharge its responsibilities under the Refugee Convention or the Charter. More specifically, it is premature to consider whether the principle of non-refoulement is at risk of violation in respect of the applicants. [15] The proper interpretation of s 101(1)(d) was recently considered by Justice Richard Southcott in Farah, above. Justice Southcott carefully considered the applicable authorities and the submissions of the parties before him and concluded that the officer in that case had not erred in finding the applicant ineligible for refugee protection \u201cnotwithstanding his assertion that he fears persecution in the country which granted him refugee status\u201d (at para 2). In other words, Justice Southcott agreed with the interpretation of s 101(1)(d) urged here by the Minister. [16] The applicants suggest that Justice Southcott did not have the benefit of the arguments they are advancing here, namely, that a finding of ineligibility for persons who fear persecution in the country where they have refugee status violates Canada\u2019s obligations under the Refugee Convention and the requirements of the Charter. In fact, Justice Southcott noted that these arguments had been presented in the earlier cases dealing with the equivalent of s 101(1)(d) and had been rejected. In addition, he found that the applicable authorities confirm that Charter considerations arise at the stage of removal from Canada not at the point of determining eligibility or admissibility. [17] On the question of the availability of a PRRA, Justice Southcott offered a tentative conclusion, given that the parties had not provided detailed submissions on the issue. He again observed that the issue of non-refoulement arises at the removal stage, not at the point of deciding eligibility of refugee protection. He also considered the UNHCR Note on the Interpretation of Article 1E of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees (March 2009) which states that a person who has status in another country, but who fears persecution in that country, should not be excluded from refugee protection. He found that the Note was not determinative because it supported the submissions of both parties before him, but conceded that the parties had not made specific submissions on the meaning of the Note. In the end, Justice Southcott certified the following question of general importance: As a matter of statutory interpretation, does ineligibility under s 101(1)(d) of IRPA include those who are making a refugee claim against the country that has recognized them as refugees? [18] No appeal was pursued in Farah, so the question certified by Justice Southcott has not been answered by the Federal Court of Appeal. [19] The applicants maintain that their submissions should bring about a different interpretation of s 101(1)(d) from that which prevailed in Farah and the earlier cases. In particular, they point out that: IRPA should be interpreted so as to comply with Canada\u2019s international obligations, especially international human rights instruments (IRPA s 3(3)(f); R v Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59 at para 40); and IRPA should also be interpreted in keeping with it fundamental purposes, including saving lives and protecting persons subject to persecution, and treating refugee claimants fairly. [20] The applicants also point to the UNHCR\u2019s Note on Article 1E. Article 1E excludes from refugee protection persons who are recognized as having the same rights and obligations as nationals of the country in which they have taken up residence. The applicants contend that Article 1E is the equivalent of s 101(1)(d) of IRPA and that the UNHCR\u2019s guidance on the application of Article 1E should influence the interpretation of s 101(1)(d). The UNHCR says that it would undermine the object and purposes of the Refugee Convention if Article 1E were applied to persons who fear persecution in the country where they have status. [21] As I read the UNHCR\u2019s note, it would offend the principle of non-refoulement if persons were excluded from refugee protection in Canada and returned to a country where they have a well-founded fear of persecution even if they have status in that country equivalent to nationality. [22] However, that is not the situation the applicants face. They are ineligible for refugee status in Canada, but no steps have been taken to return them to a country where they face a well-founded fear of persecution. [23] As mentioned above, the applicants may not be entitled under IRPA to a PRRA. However, the Minister\u2019s policy is that persons who claim a risk in the country to which they may be returned are entitled to have that risk assessed before removal. Any potential infringement of the principle of non-refoulement is, at present, speculative. [24] The applicants argue that any risk assessment they receive will inevitably be inadequate. The Minister\u2019s policy does not provide for an oral hearing and there is no guarantee that the person conducting the assessment will be qualified to carry it out. [25] Again, I find their concerns to be premature. If there are problems or shortcomings relating to the risk assessment the applicants receive, they will have remedies at that stage, including access to this Court for a stay of removal. [26] Accordingly, I cannot conclude that the officer\u2019s finding of ineligibility was unreasonable. IV. Did the officer treat the applicants unfairly? [27] The applicants argue that the officer\u2019s reasons for finding them ineligible for refugee protection (\u201cYou have been recognized as a Convention Refugee by another country\u201d) are inadequate. The officer appears not to have considered the actual requirements of s 101(1)(d), described above. Specifically, the officer appears not to have determined whether the applicants could be returned to Uganda. Further, the officer failed to give the applicants a chance to respond to the officer\u2019s concerns about their eligibility. [28] I disagree. The onus fell on the applicants to establish their eligibility for refugee protection. The officer\u2019s reasons were adequate in the circumstances as it was made clear to the applicants why they were ineligible for refugee protection. Further, their rights at the eligibility stage are circumscribed; their Charter rights are not engaged until the removal stage. V. Conclusion and Disposition [29] The officer\u2019s conclusion that the applicants are ineligible for refugee protection was not unreasonable. Nor did the officer treat the applicants unfairly. I must, therefore, dismiss this application for judicial review. [30] The applicants ask me to certify the same question as was stated by Justice Southcott in Farah. However, that question was directed to a slightly different set of circumstances. I would restate the question as follows: Are persons ineligible for refugee protection under s 101(1)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 if they have obtained refugee status in another country, even if they have a well-founded fear of persecution in that country? JUDGMENT IN IMM-6388-18 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The application for judicial review is dismissed. The following question of general importance is certified: Are persons ineligible for refugee protection under s 101(1)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 if they have obtained refugee status in another country, even if they have a well-founded fear of persecution in that country? \"James W.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200106 Docket: IMM-1761-19 Citation: 2020 FC 17 [UNREVISED CERTIFIED ENGLISH TRANSLATION] Ottawa, Ontario, January 6, 2020 Present: The Honourable Mr. Justice McHaffie BETWEEN: NAWRAS TAMAN Applicant And THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] The immigration officer who refused Nawras Taman\u2019s permanent residence application relied on the incorrect provision in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR], and did not rule on the questions required to process the application. As a result, the decision is not reasonable, and must be reversed. [2] Mr. Taman applied for permanent residence as a member of the \u201cConvention refugees abroad\u201d class. To determine whether he belongs to this class, sections 139, 144 and 145 of the IRPR require the officer to determine: (i) whether Mr. Taman is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, in accordance with section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], and (ii) whether there is a reasonable prospect of a durable solution in a country other than Canada. However, the officer only analyzed whether Mr. Taman belonged to the \u201ccountry of asylum\u201d class, and his analysis was limited to the criteria in section 147 of the IRPR, which do not even apply. [3] As the officer applied the incorrect provision of the IRPR and did not analyze the correct provisions, the decision is not reasonable. The application for judicial review is therefore allowed, and the case is referred back for reconsideration. II. Mr. Taman\u2019s application [4] Mr. Taman is a citizen of Syria. His father is Syrian, and his mother is Lebanese. His parents divorced in 1996. In 1998, he moved to Lebanon with his mother. He has had permanent resident status in Lebanon since 2011, and renews his permit annually. [5] In August 2016, Mr. Taman applied for permanent residence in Canada, claiming protection in Canada as a \u201crefugee outside Canada\u201d or a \u201crefugee abroad\u201d. He holds a registration certificate issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and his application for permanent residence was sponsored in the refugee category by a Canadian Jesuit group. Mr. Taman submitted his protection application as he fears his return to Syria should Lebanon refuse to renew his permanent resident status. In particular, he would be asked to join the Syrian army since he has not completed his mandatory military service. III. Relevant provisions [6] Under subsection 11(1) of the IRPA, every foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa following an examination. A foreign national outside Canada who applies for refugee protection in Canada may submit an application for permanent residence if they meet the definition of refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA. [7] To this end, subsection 139(1) of the IRPR states that a permanent resident visa shall be issued to the foreign national who shows that they meet the requirements of this section. In particular, a foreign national must establish that they are outside Canada, that they are seeking entry to Canada to reside permanently, and that they comply with paragraphs 139(1)(d) and (e): (d) the foreign national is a person in respect of whom there is no reasonable prospect, within a reasonable period, of a durable solution in a country other than Canada, namely d) aucune possibilit\u00e9 raisonnable de solution durable n\u2019est, \u00e0 son \u00e9gard, r\u00e9alisable dans un d\u00e9lai raisonnable dans un pays autre que le Canada, \u00e0 savoir : (i) voluntary repatriation or resettlement in their country of nationality or habitual residence, or (i) soit le rapatriement volontaire ou la r\u00e9installation dans le pays dont il a la nationalit\u00e9 ou dans lequel il avait sa r\u00e9sidence habituelle, (ii) resettlement or an offer of resettlement in another country; (ii) soit la r\u00e9installation ou une offre de r\u00e9installation dans un autre pays; (e) the foreign national is a member of one of the classes prescribed by this Division; e) il fait partie d\u2019une cat\u00e9gorie \u00e9tablie dans la pr\u00e9sente section; [Emphasis added.] [Je souligne.] [8] Several categories are established in this division (Division 1, Part 8 of the IRPR), including the \u201cConvention refugees abroad\u201d class, which is addressed in sections 144 and 145 of the IRPR, and \u201ccountry of asylum\u201d class, which is addressed in sections 146 and 147 of the IRPR. [9] A foreign national is a \u201cConvention refugee abroad\u201d when an officer determines that the foreign national is a Convention refugee: IRPR, s 145. Section 96 of the IRPA adopts the Convention\u2019s definition of refugee. As a result, section 145 of the IRPR requires the foreign national outside Canada to show that they meet the requirements of section 96 of the IRPA to be eligible as a Convention refugee: Saifee v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 589 at para 37. [10] The \u201ccountry of asylum\u201d class is distinct. To be included in this class, a foreign national must need to relocate because: (a) \u201cthey are outside all of their countries of nationality and habitual residence\u201d, and (b) \u201cthey have been, and continue to be, seriously and personally affected by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights in each of those countries\u201d [emphasis added]: IRPR, ss 147(a), (b); see also Saifee at para 38. IV. Refusal of application [11] Following an interview with an immigration officer in February 2019, Mr. Taman received a letter informing him that his application for permanent residence was rejected. According to the officer, Mr. Taman was not a refugee under the IRPA and was ineligible under a \u201cclass established\u201d in the IRPR. After reproducing section 96 of the IRPA, and sections 145, 147 and 139(1)(d) and (e) of the IRPR, the officer\u2019s only analysis is the following: [translation] After carefully assessing your application, I have determined that you do not meet the requirements of A96 [section 96 of the IRPA] or R147 [section 147 of the RIPR], and that you therefore do not meet the requirements under paragraph 139(1)(e) of the Regulations. You have been in Lebanon since the hostilities in Syria began and long enough so that Lebanon is considered your country of habitual residence. There is no reason at the moment to believe that your ability to remain in this country of habitual residence will not continue to be viable. Given that you have been outside Syria since the hostilities began (or civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights), I am not convinced that you are seriously and personally affected by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights, or that you otherwise meet the definition required for this class of application. [Emphasis added.] [12] It is clear from this excerpt, especially the second paragraph with the two references to habitual residence and the civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights, that the officer analyzed the requirements of section 147 of the IRPR, namely the section on the \u201ccountry of asylum\u201d class. This section and this class do not apply to Mr. Taman\u2019s application, which was presented under the \u201cConvention refugee abroad\u201d class. [13] There is no analysis in the officer\u2019s decision of the requirements in section 145 of the IRPR or section 96 of the IRPA. He only states that [translation] \u201cyou do not meet the requirements of A96\u201d, which is clearly insufficient to support such a conclusion. On the contrary, it seems he simply erred with regard to the section of the IRPR that applied in the present case. Instead of considering whether Mr. Taman was a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d, the officer determined whether he was a member of the \u201ccountry of asylum\u201d class. [14] I note that in his analysis, the officer referred to Mr. Taman\u2019s ability to \u201cremain in this country of habitual residence\u201d. Although the sustainability of a solution in a country other than Canada is relevant for paragraph 139(1)(d), this short reference does not constitute an analysis of paragraph 139(1)(d) of the IRPR, or a rejection of Mr. Taman\u2019s application on this basis. The officer included paragraph 139(1)(d) in the provisions in his letter to Mr. Taman, but there is nothing else that suggests he was rejecting Mr. Taman\u2019s application based on this paragraph. On the contrary, the officer specifically indicated in his reasons that he was rejecting the application pursuant to paragraph 139(1)(e) rather than 139(1)(d) of the IRPR. This conclusion was confirmed by the Minister\u2019s representative during the hearing, when he admitted that the officer did not conduct a paragraph 139(1)(d) analysis. V. Conclusion [15] Since it was based on the incorrect provision of the IRPR, the officer\u2019s decision is not reasonable and cannot be upheld. The application for judicial review is allowed. No party proposed that a question be certified, and none is certified. JUDGMENT in IMM\u20111761\u201119 THIS COURT DECIDES as follows: The application for judicial review is allowed, and the decision is referred back to another officer for reconsideration. No question is certified. \u201cNicholas McHaffie\u201d Judge Certified true translation This 15th day of January 2020.

{"doc_text": " RAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAR : MB907273 MB907274 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Milfort (the female appellant) is a citizen of Haiti. Her minor son, Jocelerme Jean-Charles Milfort (the minor appellant), is a citizen of Brazil. The female appellant fears that, if she were to return to Haiti, her life would be at risk because of her brotherinlaw, Jude Henry Mo\u00efse who is seeking revenge because she sold the house that was purchased with money belonging to her husband, who is also Mr. Mo\u00efse's brother. The minor appellant fears that, if he were to return to Brazil, he would be persecuted because of the way Haitians are treated in Brazil. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the appellants\u2019 claim for refugee protection because it found that the female appellant was not a credible witness. The RPD further concluded that the female appellant had failed to establish a prospective risk should she return to Haiti. The appellants submit that the RPD erred in its assessment of the female appellant\u2019s credibility and in its analysis of the prospective risk in Haiti. Additionally, they submit that the RPD erred by failing to analyze the prospective risk the minor appellant would face should he return to Brazil. The determinative issues for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) are the applicability of exclusion clause 1E to the female appellant\u2019s situation and the existence of a prospective risk for the minor appellant should he return to Brazil. The RAD concludes that the RPD erred in its analysis of the applicability of the Article 1E exclusion to the female appellant\u2019s situation for the reasons that follow. The RAD concludes that the female appellant is a person described in Article 1E of the Convention. With regard to the minor appellant, the RAD concludes that the RPD erred by failing to analyze the risk he would face if he were to return to Brazil. However, the RAD concludes that he failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution or demonstrate the existence of a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) if he were to return to Brazil. The appeal is dismissed. BACKGROUND The appellants\u2019 allegations can be found in the female appellant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), and can be summarized as follows: The female appellant was threatened in Haiti by her husband\u2019s brother. He is still looking for her and is threatening vengeance. The female appellant\u2019s purchase of a house is the source of the conflict. In September 2013, the female appellant left Haiti for Brazil. The appellants left Brazil in 2016 because of the political instability and attacks, discrimination, and racism toward Haitians. The female appellant also fears violence against women if she were to return to Haiti. The minor appellant fears that his life would be in danger should he return to Brazil because of the discrimination Haitians face there. The RPD examined the applicability of exclusion clause 1E. It concluded that the female appellant never obtained permanent residence in Brazil. The RPD also concluded that the status possessed by the female appellant in Brazil did not grant her the same rights as those enjoyed by Brazilian citizens. The RPD also examined the possibility of the female appellant\u2019s obtaining permanent residence due to the minor appellant being Brazilian. However, the RPD concluded that it did not have sufficient evidence to determine whether that option was available to the female appellant. Consequently, the RPD concluded that the female appellant was not excluded under Article 1E of the Convention. The RAD notes that the recent documentary evidence clarifies the evidence that was available at the time of the hearing before the RPD with regard to the possibility of the female appellant becoming a permanent resident of Brazil on the basis of family reunification. Consequently, by providing notice of a new issue, the RAD invited the appellants to make submissions regarding the possibility of the female appellant returning to Brazil and obtaining permanent resident status via a family reunification visa, given that the minor appellant is a Brazilian citizen. The RAD also invited the appellants to provide submissions regarding the applicability of the Article 1E exclusion and of Osazuwa v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 155. ANALYSIS The RAD conducted an independent assessment of the evidence, including listening to the recording of the hearing. The RAD applied the standard of correctness. Applicability of exclusion clause 1E In response to the notice of a new issue from the RAD, the appellants submit that the RAD is not a de novo tribunal and suggest that since the RPD concluded that the female appellant is not a person described in Article 1E of the Convention, there is no need for the RAD to revisit this issue. Although the RAD is not a de novo tribunal, it can raise new issues. However, the RAD must inform the parties and give them the opportunity to provide submissions in accordance with the rules of natural justice. That was done in this case. Furthermore, the Federal Court has ruled that, before granting refugee protection, the RAD is obligated to consider whether the exclusion clause applies. After taking into account the appellants\u2019 submissions and weighing the factors set out in Zeng (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Zeng, 2010 FCA 118) [Zeng], the RAD concludes that the RPD erred in its analysis of the applicability of exclusion clause 1E. Although the RAD arrived at the conclusion that the RPD erred in its analysis of the female appellant\u2019s credibility and in its analysis of prospective risk in Haiti, the RAD concludes that the female appellant is a person referred to in Article 1E of the Convention. The female appellant could have obtained permanent residence in Brazil at the time of the hearing The RAD concludes that the RPD erred in concluding that it had insufficient evidence to determine whether the female appellant could have obtained permanent resident status based on her child being a Brazilian citizen. The RAD is of the opinion that, at the time of the hearing before the RPD, the female appellant could have obtained permanent resident status in Brazil. The appellants argue that there is insufficient evidence on the record to conclude that the female appellant could obtain permanent resident status based on her child being a Brazilian citizen. They contend that the documentary evidence is silent as to the evaluation criteria for granting permanent residence to the parents of Brazilian children. They further submit that Brazilian law does not stipulate whether or not the Brazilian child must be physically present in Brazil for the parent to be able to apply for permanent residence status. They also argue that, according to the documentary evidence, the parent who does not reside in Brazil must have valid status in Canada, which is not the case for the female appellant. The RAD took into consideration the documentary evidence that was before the RPD at the time of the hearing. This evidence shows that Brazil has a program that enables the parents of children born in Brazil to obtain permanent residency. The RAD notes that, as the RPD and the appellants stated, the documentary evidence shows that individuals who wish to obtain a family reunification visa must submit their application to the Federal Police office in the area in which they reside. However, nothing in the evidence states that these procedures are exhaustive. In light of the foregoing, the RAD is of the opinion that the onus is on the female appellant to demonstrate that she could not obtain permanent residence in Brazil. Furthermore, contrary to the appellants\u2019 arguments, since the hearing before the RPD, the Response to Information Request (RIR) found at Tab 14.14 of the most recent National Documentation Package on Haiti clarifies the issue of the right to Brazilian citizenship that was in effect at the time of the RPD hearing. It is clear from the information in that RIR that the female appellant could obtain permanent residence in Brazil because she has a Brazilian child. The RAD finds that, under Brazilian law, family reunification visas are granted to immigrants who have a child of Brazilian nationality. The visa application can be submitted in person at a Brazilian consulate. A family reunification visa makes it possible to reside permanently in Brazil. Furthermore, Brazilian law allows parents of children with Brazilian citizenship to become naturalized citizens after living in Brazil for one year. Nothing in the documentary evidence indicates that the Brazilian child must be in Brazil when the visa application is submitted to the consulate. This requirement is not mentioned in Brazilian law or on the website of the Consulate General of Brazil in Montr\u00e9al. Based on the information in the RIR, the RAD concludes that the female appellant could obtain a family reunification visa through mere formalities. The RAD is of the opinion that the fact that the RIR mentions that nonCanadians must provide proof of legal status in Canada does not lead to the conclusion that refugee protection claimants in Canada would be denied such a visa. The onus is on the female appellant to demonstrate that she cannot obtain this type of visa, for example, by providing a response from the consulate indicating that she cannot submit an application. The female appellant was questioned at the hearing about the possibility of returning to Brazil given that she has a Brazilian child. The female appellant responded that she was unaware that this option was available to her and that she did not want to return to Brazil. The female appellant provided no evidence showing that Brazilian authorities would refuse to issue her a family reunification visa because she is a refugee protection claimant in Canada. It was open to the female appellant to obtain information from the Brazilian consulate regarding the procedure for obtaining permanent residence. There is no evidence before the RAD to show that any such steps were taken. In light of the foregoing, the RAD concludes that, at the time of the hearing, the female appellant could have obtained permanent resident status in Brazil, but she did not do so. It is important, however, to determine whether this status is substantially similar to that of Brazilian nationals. The status of permanent residents in Brazil is substantially similar to that of Brazilian nationals The RAD concludes that the rights of permanent residents in Brazil are substantially the same as those of Brazilian nationals. In response to the RAD\u2019s notice, the appellants argue that given the treatment of AfroBrazilians, Haitians, and women of colour in Brazil, their rights are not substantially similar to those of Brazilian nationals. The RAD is of the opinion that the way the female appellant would be treated as a Black Haitian woman if she were to return to Brazil is not relevant in determining whether the rights of permanent residents in Brazil are substantially similar to those of Brazilian nationals. Rather, the issue is whether status in the third country gives an applicant the same rights and obligations as those enjoyed by the nationals of that country, including the right to work without restrictions, the right to study, the right to full access to social services and the right of return. In this case, the issue is therefore whether the rights granted to permanent residents of Brazil by the constitution are substantially the same as those of nationals of that country. That said, the treatment of women of colour and Haitians in Brazil is relevant in the context of analyzing another factor, namely prospective risk. That factor will be analyzed below. As to the rights conferred on permanent residents of Brazil,, there are certain restrictions on the rights of foreigners in Brazil, the most significant ones being exclusion from military service, voting, and certain public offices. However, the Brazilian constitution guarantees foreign nationals residing in Brazil the same rights as those of Brazilian citizens in the areas of education, health, employment and social security. Consequently, the RAD finds that the rights of permanent residents of Brazil are substantially the same as those of Brazilian nationals. It is also important to determine whether the female appellant could return to Brazil. The female appellant has the option of returning to Brazil The RAD concludes that the female appellant could return to Brazil by obtaining permanent resident status through a family reunification visa. The RAD does not agree with the appellants\u2019 arguments that the possibility for the female appellant to return to Brazil is purely theoretical and has no material application to her case. As mentioned previously, the RAD is of the opinion that the female appellant could obtain permanent resident status in Brazil through mere formalities. Consequently, the RAD concludes that the female appellant has not demonstrated that she would be unable to obtain a family reunification visa while outside Brazil and thereby obtain permanent resident status. The RAD is of the opinion that the female appellant has failed to discharge her burden of establishing that she would not be able to return to Brazil. This factor weighs in favour of exclusion. However, it is important to analyze the risk the female appellant would face if she were to return to Brazil. The female appellant has not established that she would face a serious possibility of persecution nor has she demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be personally subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA if she were to return to Brazil. The RAD concludes that the female appellant has not established that she would face a serious possibility of persecution nor has she demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that she would be personally subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA if she were to return to Brazil. The appellants submit that AfroBrazilians and women of colour are subjected to extreme racial discrimination, which rebuts the presumption of state protection. In accordance with Majebi (2016 FCA 274) at paragraph 9, given the conclusion that the RPD erred in its analysis of the applicability of exclusion clause 1E, the RAD has taken into consideration the most recent documentary evidence as to the treatment of Haitians in Brazil rather than what was available at the time of the RPD hearing. The RAD also took into consideration the female appellant\u2019s testimony. The RAD took into consideration the documentary evidence to which the appellants refer regarding the treatment of AfroBrazilians in Brazil. Although this evidence reveals that AfroBrazilians do experience widespread social exclusion and suffer much higher levels of violence than whites, the RAD notes that it is also stated that this violence is particularly present in marginalized communities such as favelas and periferias. The female appellant does not allege that she was living in such communities. The female appellant testified that she lived in Belo Horizonte. According to her testimony, there were some Brazilians living in her neighbourhood. The only problem that she stated she had with her neighbours is that they did not want her child to shout. Furthermore, the female appellant has not demonstrated that she would be living in a marginalized community if she were to return to Brazil. Contrary to the appellants\u2019 submissions, this evidence does not support a finding that all women of colour in Brazil are subjected to generalized or systematic acts of violence, marginalization or social exclusion. In this case, the female appellant, as a Black Haitian woman, was not subjected to such treatment. The RAD also considered the documentary evidence cited by the appellants with regard to racial violence in Brazil. Contrary to the appellants\u2019 arguments, this evidence does not support a conclusion that all people of colour in Brazil are systematically subjected to violence by state agents. The documentary evidence taken as a whole demonstrates the existence of racial discrimination and racism in Brazil. With regard to access to employment, according to an RIR on how Haitians are treated, racial inequality is a serious problem in Brazil and most Brazilians who live in poverty are Black. However, the same document states that Haitians make up the largest immigrant nationality in Brazil\u2019s labour market. Another RIR referred to by the appellants states that cases of slave labour have been identified. However, this information does not support a conclusion that all Haitians are subjected to such treatment. Furthermore, in 2018, sources reported that Haitians were finding work, particularly in the construction and hotel industries. According to the representative of an organization active in welcoming and aiding immigrants to Brazil (Compassiva), not speaking Portuguese is the main barrier Haitians face in accessing employment. That same representative states that in terms of the right to work and safety, Haitians are treated the same way as other members of Brazilian society. As for access to education, although the appellants cite an excerpt from the RIR that states that some Haitians were told there were no places left for their children, the same source cited in the RIR also stated that access to education is very complicated, that there are not enough spots in schools, and that this is a \u201cnational problem.\u201d Furthermore, the RIR does not state whether the children who were refused a spot in school were Brazilian or foreign nationals. The minor appellant is Brazilian. The documentary evidence as a whole does not support a finding that Brazilian children who are Black are refused access to schooling. As for the treatment of Haitians by society, sources cited in the RIR state that Haitians are not socially accepted and that they are affected by the racist protests. There is mention that a violent incident occurred in August 2015 against Haitian nationals but that the evidence is unclear as to whether it was an incident of racism or a settling of scores related to drug trafficking. A United Nations report from 2016 states that migrant workers, including Haitians, have been exploited and that some Haitians have been victims of violent attacks, apparently due to their race and nationality. The RAD notes that the violent incidents recounted by the documentary evidence seem to be isolated incidents that took place about three years ago. The female appellant testified that her fear of returning to Brazil stems from what she has seen on television, namely, that thieves are breaking into homes, kidnapping children and killing the parents. However, the female appellant did not demonstrate that these thieves are targeting people of colour in particular. In light of the objective documentary evidence regarding crime in Brazil, the RAD concludes that individuals in Brazil face a general risk of being targeted by thieves. With regard to the female appellant\u2019s experiences in Brazil, the RAD accepts that she was the victim of discrimination. At the hearing, the female appellant stated that she could not return to Brazil because she is Black. The female appellant testified as to her difficulties finding a daycare for her son. In the opinion of the RAD, her testimony on this aspect was contradictory. On the one hand, the male appellant testified that sometimes when she went to pick up her son at daycare, they did not want to take him and that she and her son got looks because they are Black. On the other hand, the female appellant later adjusted her testimony and stated that, when she looked for a daycare for her son, no one wanted to take him, which suggests that she did not find a daycare for her son. The female appellant also explained that, at her workplace in Brazil, all of the cleaning staff were given gloves except for her because she is Black. The female appellant stated that this situation was humiliating. She also stated that Black people cannot take the bus because people spit on them and that her husband had been humiliated at work. In her BOC Form, the female appellant states that she left Brazil because of the prevailing insecurity and because of the discrimination and racism toward Haitians. She also states that she was able to find work at the beginning of her stay in Brazil, but that she was unable to do so later. However, she does not state whether this difficulty was because she is a woman of colour. The RAD notes that the female appellant states that there was a job shortage in the country, which could explain why she had trouble finding a job. The documentary evidence states that Brazil\u2019s economy was in a recession in 2015\u20132016. Furthermore, according to her refugee protection claim forms, the female appellant was unemployed between October 2014 and May 2015. The RAD notes that the minor appellant was born in October 2014. The period when the female appellant did not work in Brazil seems to coincide with the minor appellant\u2019s birth. Furthermore, on the same form, the female appellant states that she worked from May 2015 to September 2016, when she left Brazil. The female appellant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to establish that she was unable to find work in Brazil because she is a woman of colour or that she was unable to find a daycare for her son. In the RAD\u2019s opinion, the problems described by the female appellant do not amount to persecution. The RAD concludes that the evidence on the record does not lead to the conclusion that the problems the female appellant encountered in Brazil are tantamount to persecution, even when considered cumulatively, or that there is a serious possibility of her being persecuted on one of the five Convention grounds if she were to return to Brazil. Furthermore, the female appellant has not demonstrated that she would be personally subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA if she were to return to Brazil. The Refugee Appeal Division concludes that it is not necessary to analyze the risk in the country of origin, namely Haiti In the opinion of the RAD, Osazuwa v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 155 applies to the circumstances in this case. Certain facts do differ, because in Osazuwa the refugee protection claimant had obtained the status of permanent resident in Italy, a status that he had lost because he had allowed it to expire, and the refugee protection claimant did not discharge his burden before the RAD of demonstrating that he could not return to his former country of residence, namely Italy. In the present case, the female appellant has not discharged her burden of establishing that she could not return to Brazil. In Osazuwa, the Court concluded as follows: [51] Having concluded that the Applicant can return to Italy, there was nothing unreasonable about the conclusion that there was no point in analysing the risks faced by the Applicant in Nigeria. In view of the foregoing, namely that the female appellant can return to Brazil, a country where she has not demonstrated the existence of a prospective risk, the RAD concludes that there is no reason to analyze the risks she would face in Haiti. Concluding that the female appellant is a person referred to in Article 1E of the Convention does not breach Canada\u2019s international obligations The RAD concludes that Canada\u2019s international obligations would not be contravened by applying Article 1E of the Convention. Under the circumstances, because she is the mother of a Brazilian child, the female appellant could return to Brazil by obtaining a family reunification visa. The female appellant did not establish a serious possibility of persecution in Brazil on one of the five Convention grounds. Additionally, she did not demonstrate that she would be subjected personally to any of the risks listed in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA if she were to return to Brazil. Consequently, concluding that she is a person referred to in Article 1E of the Convention does not contravene Canada\u2019s international obligations. Consequently, the RAD concludes that the female appellant is a person referred to in Article 1E of the Convention. Minor appellant The RAD concludes that the RPD erred by not analyzing the existence of a prospective risk for the minor appellant should he return to Brazil. However, the RAD concludes that the minor appellant failed to establish a serious possibility of persecution and did not demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that there is a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA if he were to return to Brazil. As previously mentioned, the evidence on the record does not lead to the conclusion that the problems the female appellant encountered in Brazil are tantamount to persecution, even when considered cumulatively, or that there is a serious possibility of her being persecuted on one of the five Convention grounds if she were to return to Brazil. This analysis also applies to the minor appellant\u2019s situation, given that his refugee protection claim is based on that of the female appellant. CONCLUSION The RAD dismisses the appeal. The RAD confirms the determination of the RPD on other grounds. The RAD determines that Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Milfort is not a refugee or person in need of protection because she is excluded under Article 1E of the Convention. Furthermore, her son, Jocelerme Jean-Charles Milfort, is neither a \u201cConvention refugee\u201d under section 96 of the IRPA nor a \u201cperson in need of protection\u201d within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200113 Docket: IMM-2683-19 Citation: 2020 FC 34 Ottawa, Ontario, January 13, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Roy BETWEEN: JIE LIN Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] This judicial review application is concerned with a decision of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of April 8, 2009. The claim for Refugee Protection pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c 27 [the Act] was dismissed. The judicial review application is made pursuant to section 72 of the Act. I. The facts [2] The facts of this case are very simple. The applicant alleges that he became a practitioner of Falun Gong in August 2011, because, suffering from sharp pain in his arms and shoulders, he was encouraged to become a practitioner. The applicant was a cook in his country of origin, China. Having seen a doctor who advised that there was no good medicine to alleviate the pain, as well as a traditional health practitioner in China, he took advice, in July 2011, from a good friend who suggested he try Falun Gong. According to the applicant\u2019s Personal Information Form (PIF), the friend \u201ctold me that Falun Gong could make me strong and once I was strong my pain would be gone\u201d (Certified Tribunal Record (CTR) p. 20). It appears that the applicant was aware that the practice was frowned upon by the authorities in China because he states in his PIF that \u201c(b)ut I asked him whether he had any fear of the Government\u2019s crackdown and he told me that they had lookouts during their practice and they had escape plans in case emergency happened [sic]\u201d (CTR, p. 21). [3] The applicant started the practice with a group in early August 2011: they were 13 people. The practice happened on weekends. It appears that the pain in the shoulders and the arms almost disappeared within a few months. [4] On June 24, 2012, the applicant was practicing Falun Gong with his group in someone else\u2019s house. At about the halfway mark of the session, a lookout called the coach, which allowed the applicant to escape through the back door before the Public Security Bureau (PSB) arrived at the front door. The applicant went into hiding to his cousin\u2019s house. Three days later, on June 27, the applicant\u2019s parents called the cousin\u2019s house to inform that \u201cthe PSB had gone to my parents\u2019 house looking for me\u201d. There is no indication as to how the PSB could have identified the applicant as one of the practitioners when they raided the Falun Gong practice on June 24, 2012. Nevertheless, the PSB is said to have left a summons, dated June 27, 2012, for an appearance to take place on June 29, 2012. The summons indicated the offence as \u201cbeing involved in illegal Falun Gong activities and recruiting members for illegal organization\u201d (plaintiff\u2019s factum, para 6 m)). [5] The applicant was smuggled out of China, travelling on a boat to Taiwan from which he travelled to Canada on a false Taiwanese passport. However, the applicant testified that he had no evidence of his departure from China and arrival in Canada as the false Taiwanese passport was retrieved by the smuggler. The PIF, which is stamped on October 12, 2012, states that he travelled from China to Canada on August 11, 2012 and made a Refugee Protection Claim on August 15, 2012. However, there are no details offered with respect to those events. As a matter of fact, not much more information was offered when the applicant appeared before the RPD for the hearing on March 26, 2019. II. The RPD decision [6] The case before the RPD was largely argued on the basis that it had been established that the applicant was a practitioner of Falun Gong. In a sense, the RPD found that the applicant lacked in credibility as a bona fide Falun Gong practitioner, whether that be in China, or here in Canada as part of a sur place application. [7] The story of this applicant is that, once warned that the PSB was about to raid the place where he was practicing Falun Gong, he was able to escape through the back door. The evidence presented in support of that story did not satisfy the RPD. There was no evidence of the applicant\u2019s departure from China where, allegedly, he left mainland China to go to Taiwan on a boat before being smuggled from Taiwan to Canada, using a false Taiwanese passport. Merely telling that story did not satisfy the RPD, which was looking for some corroboration about his actual exit from China. Furthermore, the visit by the PSB some three days later to leave a summons for the applicant to present himself to the third criminal division of a Court left a lot to be desired. Indeed, the RPD was quizzical about summons allegedly being left on June 27, 2012, but which appeared for the first time in March 2019. Is also somewhat unclear how it can be that the said PSB would have attended his parents\u2019 house on a regular basis for a period of seven years since June 2012, the last time being in February 2019. For the RPD, this applicant does not have the kind of profile that could attract such attention. The Board relies specifically on a United Kingdom (UK) Home Office Operational Guidance Note on China, published in November 2016. It is a note that was prepared following comments coming from Courts in the United Kingdom. The RPD quotes the following passage at paragraph 12 of its decision: ...our \ufb01rst conclusion as to risk, from the objective evidence as a whole, is that, absent special factors, there will not normally be any risk suf\ufb01cient to amount to \u201creal risk\u201d from the Chinese authorities for a person who practices Falun Gong in private and with discretion. On any assessment the number of Falun Gong practitioners in China is very large indeed. The \ufb01gures quoted range from 2 million to some 100 million. So far as can be gathered from the evidence before us, the number of people who have faced detention or re-education by the Chinese authorities as a consequence of Falun Gong activity, whilst large in absolute terms, is a relatively small proportion of the overall number of practitioners. This indicates that the large majority of those who practice Falun Gong in China in privacy and with discretion do not experience material problems with the authorities.2 [Footnote omitted.] [8] In fact, the RPD noted that the motivation of this applicant to start Falun Gong was to get rid of some upper body pain which, after three months of practicing, seemed to have subsided significantly. Given that the applicant indicated at his hearing before the RPD that he knew that there was danger in practicing Falun Gong, the RPD questioned why the applicant would continue with the practice he knew was somewhat seen as subversive by the authorities after the pain was almost gone. Furthermore, there was no explanation for how the PSB would have become aware of the practice by a group of 13 people and why he was subsequently targeted personally. [9] Thus, the RPD is doubtful about the events and it finds that \u201cit is unlikely that the PSB would be interested in or continue to search for the claimant, given his minor pro\ufb01le as a member of a group consisting of thirteen individuals who got together for an hour on weekends to practice FG in the privacy of their homes\u201d (RPD decision, para 13). [10] The RPD was also very much concerned about the summons of June 27, 2012 and the document submitted to the RPD and presented as being a \u201cDetention Dismissal Notice\u201d concerning a person supposedly found guilty of \u201cusing Falun Gong to sabotage the social order\u201d who was sentenced to four years in prison. That document, according to the translation that was offered, spoke of the jailed person being \u201cdeprived of political right 1 year from June 24, 2012 to June 23, 2016\u201d (RPD decision, para 16). [11] As for the summons, the RPD finds quite remarkable that the summons, as well as the Detention Dismissal Notice, were sent to Canada in March 2019 (the case was heard on March 26, 2019, many years after the June 24, 2012 raid). Furthermore, it is surprising, in the view of the RPD, that no other document was ever issued by the Chinese authorities despite what is being presented as multiple visits to his parents\u2019 house. The RPD says that \u201c(t)he absence of any follow-up documents, in light of the PSB\u2019s continual interest in the claimant, undermines his assertion that the PSB has targeted him and is still interested in pursuing him\u201d (RPD decision, para 15). The Detention Dismissal Notice is even more problematic in that it states that the person was released on June 23, 2016, exactly four years after the detention began, yet the document declares that the person was \u201cdeprived of political right 1 year from June 24, 2012 to June 23, 2016\u201d (RPD decision, para 16). That does not make much sense especially in view of article 58 of the Criminal Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China which provides that \u201c(a) term of deprivation of political rights as a supplementary punishment shall be counted from the date on which imprisonment or criminal detention ends\u2026\u201d (RPD decision, para 16). The Detention Dismissal Notice, offered by the applicant, does not conform to what is being presented as the law in China. The RPD concludes: The panel \ufb01nds that the information in the document is inconsistent with Article 58 of the Criminal Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China, and therefore suspect, further undermining the claimant\u2019s credibility regarding events in China prior to his arrival in Canada. (RPD decision, para 16.) These various difficulties and discrepancies made the RPD conclude that the applicant is not credible. [12] As for the refugee sur place claim, the RPD had to assess whether the applicant is a bona fide practitioner. Quoting from the United Nations Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status, the RPD notes that \u201c(w)hether such actions are suf\ufb01cient to justify a well-founded fear of persecution must be determined by a careful examination of the circumstances. Regard should be had in particular to whether such actions may have come to the notice of the authorities of the person\u2019s country of original and how they are likely to be viewed by those authorities.\u201d (RPD decision, para 19). [13] The evidence presented by the applicant is considered to be insufficient. Isolated photographs do not establish in this case a bona fide practitioner of Falun Gong. The two letters of support from practitioners in Canada are also insufficient given the generality of their contents and the fact that the authors of these letters did not participate in the hearing of March 2019. Evidence offered by friends without subjecting themselves to any cross-examination is considered not to be highly probative or credible evidence (El Bouni v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 700). Although, the applicant was able to answer questions about the Fallun Gong practice, that evidence in and of itself is said to be readily available and relatively simple to understand. More importantly, perhaps, is that when asked if he could return to China if not wanted by the PSB, the applicant now says that \u201che needed to practice with others freely in order to obtain the full bene\ufb01t of FG\u201d (RPD decision, para 22); a practice that began for the sole purpose of alleviating upper body pain now needs to be practiced with others. III. Standard of review and analysis [14] This case was heard before the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] was released, on December 19, 2019. Neither party suggested subsequently that the Vavilov decision be the framework through which the matter ought to be considered. In my view, the old framework, with its focus on deference (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 SCR 190), would take the Court to the same result as Vavilov with its focus on justification of a decision in order to be reasonable. [15] No one doubts that the standard of review in a case of this nature is reasonableness. It has been confirmed in Vavilov that reasonableness constitutes presumptively the standard of review for questions of law as well as questions of fact. None of the exceptions to the presumption is present in this case. There is still room for a measure of deference (Vavilov, above, paras 13, 75) for the decision taken by an administrative tribunal, but the new focus since Vavilov is on the reasonableness of the decision measured by reference to the reasons given. At paragraph 99 of Vavilov, one reads: [99] A reviewing court must develop an understanding of the decision maker's reasoning process in order to determine whether the decision as a whole is reasonable. To make this determination, the reviewing court asks whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision: Dunsmuir, at paras. 47 and 74; Catalyst, at para. 13. [16] Even with the focus on the decision maker\u2019s decision itself, the Court must not seek to decide the issues themselves, but rather it develops an understanding that led to the decision through an examination of the reasons given (Vavilov, para 85). But the burden remains on an applicant to show that the decision is unreasonable (Vavilov, para 100). The reviewing court will be considering if the decision is internally coherent and justified in light of the legal and factual constraints. But it continues to be true that perfection is not the required standard and the exercise does not involve the \u201cline-by line treasure hunt for error\u201d of Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, Local 30 v Irving Pulp & Paper, Ltd., 2013 SCC 34; [2013] 2 SCR 458, as endorsed by Vavilov, at paragraph 22. [17] Rather, the reviewing court looks for the rational chain of analysis within the reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived (Law Society of New Brunswick v Ryan, 2003 SCC 20; [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247, at para 55, as cited in Vavilov, at para 102). Logical fallacies, circular reasoning, false dilemmas, unfounded generalization or an absurd premise may all signal an internally incoherent reasoning. Finally, the record continues to be important and the reviewing court considers the reasons in light of the record. Once again, the Court cites with approval the decision of this Court in Komolafe v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 431, 16 Imm LR (4th) 267, at paragraph 11: [11] Newfoundland Nurses is not an open invitation to the Court to provide reasons that were not given, nor is it licence to guess what findings might have been made or to speculate as to what the tribunal might have been thinking. This is particularly so where the reasons are silent on a critical issue. It is ironic that Newfoundland Nurses, a case which at its core is about deference and standard of review, is urged as authority for the supervisory court to do the task that the decision maker did not do, to supply the reasons that might have been given and make findings of fact that were not made. This is to turn the jurisprudence on its head. Newfoundland Nurses allows reviewing courts to connect the dots on the page where the lines, and the direction they are headed, may be readily drawn. Here, there were no dots on the page. [18] In other words, the reviewing judge is not to do the job not done by a tribunal, re-writing the reasons in order to make the decision reasonable (Vavilov, para 96). But it is appropriate to connect the dots which have been identified by consulting the record. [19] In the case at hand, whether the old framework or the new one is used, the result is the same: the applicant did not satisfy his burden to show that the decision was not reasonable. The applicant\u2019s argument boils down to a different emphasis on some of the evidence on both counts, the original refugee application and the sur place application. The standard of review that must be applied remains the same: the decision must be shown to be unreasonable, which has not been accomplished on this record. It is understandable that the RPD would have found the story told by the applicant as lacking details and granularity such that it would be believable and believed. The Detention Dismissal Notice and the summons \u201carrived\u201d just in time for the hearing, some 7 years later, and their contents left a lot to be desired. It was open to the RPD to conclude that it would be surprising if the Chinese authorities had any interest in this applicant. The record in this case was very weak. The story around the events of June 2012 lacked granularity, there was no evidence to speak of around the escape from China to Taiwan to Canada, and the \u201ccorroborative\u201d evidence was next to inexistent. The sur place application is equally weak. At the end of the day, the RPD does not have to be right. The standard of review is reasonableness, not correctness. It is rather that the applicant must show that the decision was unreasonable in that it is not justified, intelligible and transparent. It is. The judicial review application must therefore be dismissed. [20] There is no question that ought to be certified pursuant to s. 74 of the Act.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200122 Docket: IMM-462-19 Citation: 2020 FC 98 Ottawa, Ontario, January 22, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice Russell BETWEEN: EMMANUEL ADEDAYO ARABAMBI, ABIMBOLA AGNES ARABAMBI, ADEMIDALE PEARL ARABAMBI, OLUWANIFEMI MICAH ARABAMBI Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. INTRODUCTION [1] This is an application under s 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [RPD], dated November 14, 2018 [Decision], denying the Applicants\u2019 refugee and person in need of protection claims under ss 96 and 97 of the IRPA. II. BACKGROUND [2] Emmanuel Adedayo Arabambi and his wife Abimbola Agnes Arabambi are citizens of Nigeria. Their daughter Ademidale Pearl Arabambi, born in 2014, is also a citizen of Nigeria while their son Oluwanifemi Micah Arabambi was born in the United States of America [USA] in November 2017 and is a citizen of the USA. [3] Ms. Arabambi and her daughter arrived in the USA on November 2, 2017, while Mr. Arabambi arrived in the USA on November 30, 2017. The family stayed with Mr. Arabambi\u2019s sister in California while on visitor visas. [4] The Applicants allege that they came to the USA because of their fear of Mr. Arabambi\u2019s family, who have repeatedly threatened to perform female genital mutilation [FGM] on Ms. Arabambi as well as their daughter. The Applicants submit that the family has threatened to sacrifice the female Applicants should they fail to conform to this practice. The Applicants explain that this is because, while they are Christian, Mr. Arabambi\u2019s family continues to practise their Yoruba religious beliefs, including FGM, which Mr. Arabambi\u2019s family maintains must be performed on females married into the family following childbirth as well as females born into the family before their fifth birthday. [5] The Applicants submit that they tried to hide from Mr. Arabambi\u2019s family by staying with Ms. Arabambi\u2019s mother in Lagos, Nigeria. However, they claim that their persecutors soon discovered their location. This fear of being located once again by their persecutors motivated their departure to the USA in November 2017. [6] On March 16, 2018, the Applicants arrived in Canada and claimed refugee status. III. DECISION UNDER REVIEW [7] On November 14, 2018, the RPD dismissed the Applicants\u2019 refugee and persons in need of protection claims under ss 96 and 97 of the IRPA, finding that: (1) Oluwanifemi Micah Arabambi was a citizen of the USA and therefore did not require protection; (2) serious credibility concerns existed due to the Applicants\u2019 failure to make a claim in the USA; and (3) a viable internal flight alternative [IFA] existed within Nigeria, notably in Port Harcourt. A. Oluwanifemi Micah Arabambi\u2019s American Citizenship [8] First, the RPD decided that Oluwanifemi Micah Arabambi, Mr. and Ms. Arabambi\u2019s son born in November 2017, was not a refugee or person in need of protection under ss 96 and 97 of the IRPA because he is an American citizen. Taking into consideration the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants\u2014Procedural and Evidentiary Issues, the RPD found that there was insufficient evidence demonstrating that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in the USA, as it is a democratic country with security forces to protect its citizens. B. Failure to Make Claim in the USA [9] The RPD found that the remaining Applicants, who hold Nigerian citizenship, are not refugees or persons in need of protection under ss 96 and 97 of the IRPA due to, in part, a lack of credible subjective fear of persecution. [10] The RPD found that the Applicants\u2019 failure to make a refugee claim in the USA demonstrates a lack of subjective fear because it is reasonable to expect that they would have sought asylum in the first safe country they entered had a genuine fear for their lives existed. [11] Though the RPD acknowledges the Applicants\u2019 argument that they had no intention of ever claiming refugee status in the USA due to President Trump\u2019s comments regarding immigrants from Africa, the RPD did not accept this explanation. The RPD found that there was insufficient credible evidence presented indicating that the Applicants would be deported from the USA for making a refugee claim while on valid visas, as there is a legal process that takes place similar to Canada\u2019s. C. Viable IFA in Port Harcourt [12] Finally, the RPD applied the two prong test set out in Rasaratnam v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 FC 706, 140 NR 138 (FCA) to assess whether a viable IFA existed. Having found that (1) it is unlikely that the Applicants would be persecuted or personally subjected to a substantial risk of death or cruel and unusual punishment in Port Harcourt, and (2) it is reasonable, in all circumstances, for the Applicants to seek refuge in Port Harcourt, the RPD concluded that a viable IFA existed. [13] The RPD noted that the Applicants are unlikely to be persecuted or subjected to personal risk in Port Harcourt given that it is a large city situated a great distance away from Lagos, Nigeria where the Applicants lived. Moreover, the RPD found that the Applicants were unable to provide sufficient credible evidence demonstrating that the agents of persecution would have the capability or desire to pursue the Applicants in Port Harcourt. [14] Though the Applicants argued at the hearing that Mr. Arabambi\u2019s brother was found by a family member while hiding in Port Harcourt, the RPD did not find this statement to be credible because the Applicants had failed to disclose this in their Basis of Claim or when asked at the beginning of the hearing whether the Basis of Claim was complete, true, and correct. Furthermore, the RPD found the Applicants\u2019 argument that Mr. Arabambi\u2019s family would be able to locate them in Port Harcourt, just as they had been able to locate them while staying with Ms. Arabambi\u2019s mother, was speculative. This is because Ms. Arabambi\u2019s mother lived in Lagos, Nigeria while Port Harcourt is a great distance away. [15] The RPD also found that the Applicants could reasonably relocate to Port Harcourt, a large urban city, as Mr. and Ms. Arabambi are well educated, have experience in the telecommunication/information technology engineering field, and speak English. Although the Applicants note that the roads into the city are dangerous and that there is significant criminal activity in Port Harcourt, the RPD found that the Applicants could fly into Port Harcourt and that criminality is a generalized risk faced by Port Harcourt\u2019s entire population. IV. ISSUES [16] The issues to be determined in the present matter solely relate to whether the RPD\u2019s decision was unreasonable. More specifically: Did the RPD err in its analysis of the Applicants\u2019 credibility? Did the RPD err in its analysis of whether a viable IFA existed in Port Harcourt? V. STANDARD OF REVIEW [17] This application was argued prior to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s recent decisions in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] and Bell Canada v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66. This Court\u2019s judgment was taken under reserve. The parties\u2019 submissions on the standard of review were therefore made under the Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir] framework. However, given the circumstances in this matter, and the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s instructions in Vavilov at para 144, this Court found that it was not necessary to ask the parties to make additional submissions on the standard of review. I have applied the Vavilov framework in my consideration of the application and it does not change the applicable standards of review in this case nor my conclusions. [18] In Vavilov, at paras 23-32, the majority sought to simplify how a court selects the standard of review applicable to the issues before it. The majority did away with the contextual and categorical approach taken in Dunsmuir in favour of instating a presumption that the reasonableness standard applies. However, the majority noted that this presumption can be set aside on the basis of (1) clear legislative intent to prescribe a different standard of review (Vavilov, at paras 33-52), and (2) certain scenarios where the rule of law requires the application of the standard of correctness, such as constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole and questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (Vavilov, at paras 53-64). [19] There was no disagreement between the parties that the applicable standard of review in this matter was the standard of reasonableness. [20] There is nothing to rebut the presumption that the standard of reasonableness applies in this case. The application of the standard of reasonableness to these issues is also consistent with the existing jurisprudence prior to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Vavilov. See Haastrup v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 711 at para 9 and Aissa v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1156 at para 56 concerning the review of a decision-maker\u2019s credibility findings and Tagne v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 273 at para 19 concerning the review of a decision-maker\u2019s assessment of an IFA. [21] When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with whether it \u201cbears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov, at para 99). Reasonableness is a single standard of review that varies and \u201ctakes its colour from the context\u201d (Vavilov, at para 89 citing Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para 59). These contextual constraints \u201cdictate the limits and contours of the space in which the decision maker may act and the types of solutions it may adopt\u201d (Vavilov, at para 90). Put in another way, the Court should intervene only when \u201cthere are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency\u201d (Vavilov, at para 100). The Supreme Court of Canada lists two types of fundamental flaws that make a decision unreasonable: (1) a failure of rationality internal to the decision-maker\u2019s reasoning process; and (2) untenability \u201cin light of the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it\u201d (Vavilov, at para 101). VI. STATUTORY PROVISIONS [22] The following statutory provisions of the IRPA are relevant to this application for judicial review: Convention refugee D\u00e9finition de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 96 A Convention refugee is a person who, by reason of a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion, 96 A qualit\u00e9 de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 au sens de la Convention \u2014 le r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 \u2014 la personne qui, craignant avec raison d\u2019\u00eatre pers\u00e9cut\u00e9e du fait de sa race, de sa religion, de sa nationalit\u00e9, de son appartenance \u00e0 un groupe social ou de ses opinions politiques : (a) is outside each of their countries of nationality and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or a) soit se trouve hors de tout pays dont elle a la nationalit\u00e9 et ne peut ou, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut se r\u00e9clamer de la protection de chacun de ces pays ; (b) not having a country of nationality, is outside the country of their former habitual residence and is unable or, by reason of that fear, unwilling to return to that country. b) soit, si elle n\u2019a pas de nationalit\u00e9 et se trouve hors du pays dans lequel elle avait sa r\u00e9sidence habituelle, ne peut ni, du fait de cette crainte, ne veut y retourner.

(iv) la menace ou le risque ne r\u00e9sulte pas de l\u2019incapacit\u00e9 du pays de fournir des soins m\u00e9dicaux ou de sant\u00e9 ad\u00e9quats. VII. ARGUMENTS A. Applicants [23] The Applicants argue that the Decision is unreasonable due to the material factual errors in the RPD\u2019s assessment of the Applicants\u2019 credibility as well as the suitability of the proposed IFA in Port Harcourt. (1) Credibility Finding [24] The Applicants argue that the RPD\u2019s credibility finding is unreasonable due to several factual errors at the heart of its analysis. They argue that the Decision does not fall within a reasonable outcome given the established facts in this case. The Applicants point to two errors of fact committed by the RPD, which they believe were improperly at the heart of its credibility finding. [25] First, the Applicants note that the RPD mistakenly stated that the Applicants stayed in the USA for fifteen months before claiming refugee status in Canada, as opposed to the three to four months they did stay. The Applicants suggest that this is a material error since their perceived length of stay in the USA was a key reason why the RPD decided that the Applicants\u2019 failure to make a claim in the USA tainted their credibility. [26] Second, the Applicants submit that the RPD misconstrued their explanation as to why they did not make a claim in the USA because the RPD failed to mention that they also cited President Trump\u2019s clear statements that African immigrants were not welcome. They argue that since their explanation as to why they did not make a claim in the USA was based on the widely reported political statements of the President of the USA, it was reasonable for them to believe that the anti-immigration policies of the USA would result in their return to Nigeria should they make a refugee claim. As such, the Applicants believe that the RPD\u2019s failure to consider the Applicants\u2019 full explanation as to why they did not make a claim in the USA was a material error at the heart of the RPD\u2019s credibility finding. [27] In light of these two critical errors of fact, the Applicants argue that the RPD\u2019s credibility finding is unreasonable because it is based on an erroneous understanding of the facts and a distorted representation of the Applicants\u2019 testimony. The Applicants note that this Court has held on numerous occasions that a credibility finding is unreasonable if it was made without regard to the evidence. See, for example, Maruthapillai v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2000] 205 FTR 263 at para 13, FCJ No 761. (2) Viability of the IFA [28] The Applicants also argue that Port Harcourt is not a viable IFA. They submit that Mr. Arabambi comes from a large polygamous family that is spread out across Nigeria and that they would therefore be found by their persecutors if they were to relocate to Port Harcourt, just as their persecutors located Mr. Arabambi\u2019s brother. [29] Moreover, they submit that it would be unreasonable for them to relocate to Port Harcourt due to the lack of promising employment prospects, the general insecurity in the area, the high cost of relocation, and the fact they know no one in the area. B. Respondent [30] The Respondent argues that: (1) any factual errors by the RPD when assessing the Applicants\u2019 credibility were immaterial; (2) the RPD accurately summarized the Applicants\u2019 testimony and; (3) the Applicants have not sufficiently demonstrated that the RPD\u2019s finding that a viable IFA existed in Port Harcourt was unreasonable. (1) Credibility Finding [31] The Respondent first submits that credibility findings are the heart of the RPD\u2019s jurisdiction, given its expertise and the fact that it is best suited to evaluate an applicant\u2019s testimony. As such, deference is owed to the RPD\u2019s credibility findings. Credibility findings should only be found unreasonable when they are made in a perverse or capricious manner, without regard to the evidence (Ikeme v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2018 FC 21 at para 15). [32] The Respondent acknowledges that the RPD erred when it stated that the Applicants had been in the USA for fifteen months instead of four months. However, given that the RPD noted the correct entry and exit dates, the Respondent submits that this was simply an arithmetical error. Moreover, the Respondent submits that the error was not material given that the RPD did not take issue with how long the Applicants were in the USA, but rather their choice not to make a claim in the USA and how this tainted their credibility. The Respondent cites this Court\u2019s decision in Hernandez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 659 at para 8. [33] Secondly, the Respondent argues that the RPD did not misconstrue their testimony but rather summarized the key substantive points at issue: (1) the Applicants\u2019 fear of being deported to Nigeria for making refugee claims; and (2) the anti-immigrant comments made by President Trump towards Africans. [34] Finally, the Respondent notes that the articles cited by the Applicants to justify their explanation as to why they decided not to make a claim in the USA demonstrate the reasonableness of the RPD\u2019s Decision. The articles make direct reference to the fact that, despite President Trump\u2019s comments, the courts have ensured the continuing operation of the existing immigration scheme. (2) Viability of the IFA [35] The Respondent argues that this Court has recognized that applicants bear the high onus of establishing that the proposed IFA was unreasonable (Iyere v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 67 at paras 32-35 [Iyere]). [36] With this in mind, the Respondent submits that the Applicants\u2019 argument fails to engage specifically with the reasonableness of any of the RPD\u2019s findings concerning the possibility of persecution in Port Harcourt, or the reasonableness of their relocation to Port Harcourt. Instead, the Respondent notes that the Applicants are simply asking this Court to re-weigh the evidence before the RPD. VIII. ANALYSIS [37] The Applicants raise two grounds for reviewable error: the Decision is based upon factual errors concerning the length of time they lived in the USA and a misconstruction of the Applicants\u2019 testimony as to why they did not make refugee claims in the USA; and the RPD\u2019s unreasonable IFA analysis. [38] The Applicants\u2019 complaint regarding the RPD\u2019s IFA analysis is detailed in their written submissions: The claimants testi\ufb01ed that although Port Harcourt is a large city with over 1.8 million inhabitants, they could not safely live in Port Harcourt without fear of detection by their persecuting family members. The male claimant testi\ufb01ed that he comes from a large polygamous family who are scattered all over Nigeria, and that the brother of the male claimant who moved to Port Harcourt out of fear for the life of his family members because they were similarly required to have their children perform FMG had to abandon Port Harcourt in a hurry to an unknown destination because their persecutors managed to find them in Port Harcourt. They also said that they know no one in the city of Port Harcourt, will suffer much financial expense in relocating there. Job and work prospects are also not very promising. The claimants were also afraid of the general insecurity in the Niger Delta part of the country and Port Harcourt in particular. This testimony showed that it will not be reasonable for them to reside in Port Harcourt without detection by their family members and that that city will not be a viable IFA. Sudhahini v M.C.I. (F.C., no IMM-7068-03) 2003 F.C. 1075. [39] At the oral hearing before me, counsel for the Applicants made additional points to the effect that it was unreasonable to expect information concerning the brother\u2019s detection to appear in the Basis of Claim when Mr. Arabambi had only received this information from his sister a week before the hearing. However, my reading of Mr. Arabambi\u2019s testimony about how and when the brother\u2019s situation was discovered reveals that Mr. Arabambi gave very vague testimony on this important point. Consequently, it was not unreasonable for the RPD to conclude there was no \u201cclear and convincing evidence from [Mr. Arabambi]\u2019s sister that such an event took place.\u201d Moreover, Mr. Arabambi was \u201casked during the introduction if the information in the [Basis of Claim] was complete, true, and correct\u201d and he \u201creplied yes.\u201d As stated by the RPD, Mr. Arabambi \u201chad an opportunity at that time to inform the [RPD] of this new information and failed to do so.\u201d The RPD\u2019s credibility concerns on this matter were thus reasonable and justified. [40] Counsel for the Applicants also raised some general points at the hearing regarding what the RPD might have considered further when assessing the existence of an IFA in Port Harcourt. Counsel for the Applicants further states that there was in the record evidence such as Canadian travel advisories, the unstable security situation, difficulties in finding employment outside the oil industry, the kidnapping of children, the lack of state protection, and the prevalence of different language groups. [41] It must always be borne in mind that, if an IFA is suggested, there is a high onus on an applicant to show it would be unreasonable to expect them to relocate there. See this Court\u2019s overview of the jurisprudence on this issue in Iyere at paras 32-35. At the hearing before the RPD, counsel for the Applicants\u2019 submissions on the IFA were as follows: The \ufb01nal issue, internal \ufb02ight alternative, Madam Member you mentioned two places, in particular or speci\ufb01cally I should say, Port Harcourt and in the Ogun area. Now there is a decision that is considered a jurisprudence guideline that is very persuasive in nature and if you decide not to follow it, which is your prerogative; you must provide reasons as to why you distinguish this case from the case at hand. <inaudible>. So there are some documents \u2026 internal \ufb02ight alternative, just internal \ufb02ight alternative in general, it is trite to say but it is a two prong test and you must be satis\ufb01ed on the balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimants being persecuted in either Port Harcourt or in Ogun state and or that they would not be subject to risk to life, risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger. So basically that is saying you have to identify a place where an internal \ufb02ight alternative is identi\ufb01ed and go to the second step and the condition in that part which you have identi\ufb01ed are considered or would not be unreasonable in the all circumstances, including the circumstances particular to the claimants, to seek refuge there. Now he mentioned, both claimants mentioned the security situation in those places which would make it even a risk to get there. And the security risk <inaudible> Nigeria. And those are not, my words, Madam Member, having imposed travel advisories and basically saying do not travel to certain areas because of the kidnapping, the violent crime, civil unrest. And the one from Canada actually mentions Port Harcourt. It says, \u201cThe Niger Delta States of Abia, Akwa, Ibom [ph] and Abura [ph] Elalici [ph] and lmo and <inaudible>, (with the exception of <inaudible> Capital City, Port Harcourt, where we advise against non-essential travel), due to the unstable security situation and the heightened risk of kidnapping.\u201d So you have . . . you have that, the civil unrest and the violence that comes with it. But you also have the Zeka virus which is there as well. But in addition to this if you say that is a proper internal \ufb02ight alternative then it would also be safe for family members of the husband to travel there. And according to the female claimant she is saying even if there is no security risk, which is only hypothetical, there is in fact a security risk, but even if there was not a security risk they would still . . . she would still be afraid of his family members. And the example that she gave was that they were still able to \ufb01nd out where she was staying even though she never told anybody, when she was staying at her mother\u2019s, I believe it was. And they found out. They found out she was pregnant without them telling anybody. So one of the family members may have seen her and reported back to the other family members. So her last sentence was, if they locate me there, which at her mother\u2018s house, or a friend\u2019s house, then they can locate me everywhere. When we talk about an internal \ufb02ight alternative we do not expect claimants to live in a cave; they have to go about their day to day lives and work. So they might be able to get a job in Port Harcourt, but so what, if you have to look over your shoulder every day to see if a family members knows that you are here. And then what do you do? Look at his brother, he stayed in a place for a year and then he had to leave because they found out where he was. It is a similarly situated person. And his brother, unfortunately, was not able to make it out of Nigeria and, but these claimants were and <inaudible> because the female claimant is saying that she had a life there. That was not their \ufb01rst option was to leave; their \ufb01rst option was to try to resolve this family tradition which is foreign to her, has nothing to do with her family. She wanted to resolve it and stay and raise their family in a safe environment. And so she made it sound like there was an ultimatum. [42] In their written submission, the Applicants simply tell the Court what was said about the Port Harcourt IFA and assert that it would not be reasonable for them to go there. This does not even raise, let alone substantiate, a reviewable error by the RPD on this issue. The Applicants are simply asking the Court to re-weigh the evidence and agree with them that Port Harcourt is not a viable IFA. The Court cannot do this. See this Court\u2019s decision in Gutierrez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 266 at para 42, as well as the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Vavilov, above, at para 83. [43] In light of the Applicants\u2019 oral submissions, I have reviewed in detail the RPD\u2019s IFA analysis against the evidence that was before it and can find no reviewable error. The availability of a viable IFA is dispositive of the Applicants\u2019 refugee claim even if the RPD erred in assessing their failure to claim asylum in the USA. [44] I have also reviewed the Applicants\u2019 allegation of mistake with regard to the failure to claim asylum in the USA and can find no reviewable error. As the Respondent points out in their submissions, the RPD\u2019s credibility finding was not related to how long the Applicants were in the USA. The concern was the Applicants\u2019 choice not to make a claim there along with their explanations for not doing so \u2013 i.e. because they had valid visitor visas and were afraid of deportation back to Nigeria if they made a claim because of the comments made by President Trump that Africans were not welcome in the USA. [45] This issue is dealt with by the RPD as follows: [23] The two female claimants travelled to the USA on valid tourist visas on November 2, 2017, to \ufb02ee her husband\u2019s/father\u2019s family. [Mr. Arabambi] arrived in the USA on November 30, 2017. They travelled to Canada to make a claim for refugee protection on March 16, 2018. They lived in the USA for one year and three months. The claimants testi\ufb01ed they never intended to make a claim for asylum in the USA. They were also frightened that, since they had valid visitor visas, they could be deported as the President stated that Nigerians were not welcome. The [RPD] does not accept this explanation. There was insuf\ufb01cient credible information presented that indicates that the claimants would be deported because they had valid visas. Furthermore, there is a legal process that takes place, similar as in Canada, to determine if a person is to receive protection. The [RPD] \ufb01nds that if the claimants have a genuine fear for their lives, it is reasonable to expect them to seek asylum in the \ufb01rst safe country they enter, which is the USA. This failure to claim gives the [RPD] credibility concerns regarding the claimants\u2019 allegations and indicates a lack of subjective fear. [46] I can find nothing that is materially unreasonable about this analysis nor the RPD\u2019s conclusions. [47] Nevertheless, the RPD\u2019s findings on the existence of a viable IFA are dispositive, and although it is possible to disagree with those findings as the Applicants have in this application, it is not, in my view, possible to say that the RPD unreasonably erred in its analysis. [48] The parties agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs. JUDGMENT IN IMM-462-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that The application is dismissed. There is no question for certification. \u201cJames Russell\u201d Judge FEDERAL COURT SOLICITORS OF RECORD DOCKET: IMM-462-19 STYLE OF CAUSE: EMMANUEL ADEDAYO ARABAMBI ET AL v THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION PLACE OF HEARING: TORONTO, ONTARIO DATE OF HEARING: OCTOBER 15, 2019 JUDGMENT AND REASONS: RUSSELL J.

Overview [1] This case concerns the decision of an immigration officer (the \u201cOfficer\u201d) dated February 20, 2019, to deny the Applicants\u2019 temporary resident visas (\u201cTRVs\u201d). The Applicants are citizens of India, and a family of three. The three files were considered together on judicial review. The Applicants had applied for TRVs to visit their relatives for a wedding anniversary celebration in Canada. The TRVs were denied as the Officer was not satisfied that the Applicants would leave Canada at the end of their stay, in particular, due to the Applicants\u2019 insufficient funds. [2] For the reasons that follow, this application for judicial review is allowed. II. Facts A. The Applicants [3] Mrs. Kuldeep Kaur Sangha (the \u201cFirst Applicant\u201d), Mr. Gurtej Singh Sangha (the \u201cSecond Applicant\u201d), and their 15-year old son, Amrinder Singh Sangha (the \u201cThird Applicant\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cApplicants\u201d) are citizens of India. The Second Applicant owns an agricultural land in India and is a dairy farmer. The First Applicant is not currently working, and the Third Applicant is enrolled in school. [4] On January 30, 2019, the Applicants applied for TRVs to attend an uncle\u2019s wedding anniversary to be celebrated on February 22, 2019. On the application, the Applicants indicated that they intended to stay in Canada for 11 days. The Applicants also submitted evidence of their movable and immovable assets to support the trip, including: an accountant\u2019s summary report stating the family\u2019s combined net worth of $235,437; an Indian Income tax return verification; and a letter from the Kore Wala Kalan Milk Producers Co-Op Society Ltd confirming the Second Applicant\u2019s annual net income from dairy farming. [5] In their applications, the Applicants included a letter of support from their extended family in Canada stating that the extended family was willing to provide all necessary financial support and accommodation during the Applicants\u2019 visit to Canada. The relatives also provided a bank statement with a balance of $28,158.80. B. Decision Under Review [6] On February 20, 2019, the Officer refused the Applicants\u2019 TRV applications. The Officer was not satisfied that the Applicants would leave Canada at the end of their stay because the Applicants had provided insufficient proof of their financial status and available funds. According to the Officer, the available funds were insufficient to facilitate the 11-day trip. [7] In consideration of the Applicants\u2019 level of economic establishment and the purpose of the trip, the Officer concluded the trip was not a reasonable or affordable expense. The Officer found that the Applicants did not demonstrate sufficient establishment or ties to India that would motivate them to return. The Officer also noted the Applicants\u2019 lack of travel history, and ultimately found the Applicants were not bona fide visitors to Canada. III. Issue and Standard of Review [8] The issue on this judicial review is whether the Officer\u2019s decision is reasonable, and in particular: Whether the Officer erred in making subjective and arbitrary findings; and Whether the Officer erred in failing to consider contradictory evidence. [9] Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (CanLII) [Vavilov], the reasonableness standard generally applied to the review of an immigration officer\u2019s refusal of a TRV: Anand v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 372 (CanLII) at para 9; Paramasivam v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 811 (CanLII) at para 14). [10] The applicable standard of review of the Officer\u2019s decision must be determined in accordance with the framework set out in Vavilov. As noted by the majority in Vavilov, \u201ca reasonable decision is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker,\u201d (Vavilov at para 85). Furthermore, \u201cthe reviewing court must be satisfied that there are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency,\u201d (Vavilov at para 100). In this case, I see no reason to deviate from the existing jurisprudence on the applicable standard of review. The reasonableness standard applies to the case at bar. IV. Relevant Provisions [11] Sections 11(1) and 20(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 (\u201cIRPA\u201d) read as follows: Application before entering Canada 11 (1) A foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or for any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document may be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this Act. Visa et documents 11 (1) L'\u00e9tranger doit, pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e au Canada, demander \u00e0 l'agent les visa et autres documents requis par r\u00e8glement. L'agent peut les d\u00e9livrer sur preuve, \u00e0 la suite d'un contr\u00f4le, que l'\u00e9tranger n'est pas interdit de territoire et se conforme \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi. Obligation on entry 20 (1) Every foreign national, other than a foreign national referred to in section 19, who seeks to enter or remain in Canada must establish, (a) to become a permanent resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and have come to Canada in order to establish permanent residence; and (b) to become a temporary resident, that they hold the visa or other document required under the regulations and will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay. Obligation \u00e0 l'entr\u00e9e au Canada 20 (1) L'\u00e9tranger non vis\u00e9 \u00e0 l'article 19 qui cherche \u00e0 entrer au Canada ou \u00e0 y s\u00e9journer est tenu de prouver: a) pour devenir un r\u00e9sident permanent, qu'il d\u00e9tient les visa ou autres documents r\u00e9glementaires et vient s'y \u00e9tablir en permanence; b) pour devenir un r\u00e9sident temporaire, qu'il d\u00e9tient les visa ou autres documents requis par r\u00e8glement et aura quitt\u00e9 le Canada \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode de s\u00e9jour autoris\u00e9e. [12] Subsection 179(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 (\u201cIRPR\u201d), reads as follows: TEMPORARY RESIDENT VISA Issuance 179 An officer shall issue a temporary resident visa to a foreign national if, following an examination, it is established that the foreign national [\u2026] (b) will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay under Division 2; VISA DE R\u00c9SIDENT TEMPORAIRE D\u00e9livrance 179. L'agent d\u00e9livre un visa de r\u00e9sident temporaire \u00e0 l'\u00e9tranger si, \u00e0 l'issue d'un contr\u00f4le, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments suivants sont \u00e9tablis: [\u2026] b) il quittera le Canada \u00e0 la fin de la p\u00e9riode de s\u00e9jour autoris\u00e9e qui lui est applicable au titre de la section 2; V. Analysis [13] The Applicants submit that the Officer\u2019s finding that the trip was not a reasonable expense was subjective and arbitrary, and that the Officer failed to consider contradictory evidence. The evidence before the Officer showed sufficient funds including: an accountant\u2019s statement showing $13,775 CAD in the Second Applicant\u2019s savings account; the Applicants\u2019 joint chequing account statement showing a balance equal to $13,448.11 CAD; the Applicants\u2019 relative\u2019s bank statement showing a total balance of $28,158 CAD; and a letter of employment for the Applicants\u2019 relative indicating his monthly salary of $11,000 CAD. As the evidence showed a combined amount of approximately $55,000 CAD readily available to the Applicants, the Applicants submit it was unreasonable for the Officer to conclude this amount was insufficient for an 11-day trip to Canada. The Applicants argue the Officer failed to consider significant evidence that contradicts the findings (Cepeda-Gutierrez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 8667 (FC)). The Applicants also submit the Officer\u2019s finding that the Applicants lack sufficient establishment and ties to India does not properly reflect evidence, as the Applicants have lived their entire lives in India: they have raised a family, own property, and run a farm in India. [14] The Respondent submits it was reasonable for the Officer to have concerns about the Applicants\u2019 ability to finance their trip because the Applicants indicated on their application that the family had $3,500 CAD available for their trip. The Respondent also submits the Officer reasonably held concerns about the Applicants\u2019 economic establishment in India because the family had an annual income of $16,328 CAD. With respect to the letter of support from their relatives, the Respondent relies on Clement v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 703 (CanLII) at paras 29-30 for the proposition that the provision of a bond does not necessitate granting a TRV. The Respondent submits the Officer was not required to address the financial situation of the uncle and aunt, or their promise to support the Applicants. [15] In my view, the Officer erred by failing to consider contradictory evidence and making subjective and arbitrary findings, which render the decision unreasonable. Although the Officer found there were insufficient funds for the trip, there was significant evidence to the contrary. On each application, it was indicated that the Applicant had $3,500 CAD available for the trip. Since each application was submitted individually, the most obvious explanation would be that each Applicant would have $3,500 CAD in available funds for an 11-day trip, not that the entire family would be limited to $3,500 CAD. Even given the latter scenario, the Officer\u2019s conclusion fails to have regard to other contradictory evidence, since there were approximately $55,000 CAD in available funds for the Applicants. [16] It is unclear why the Officer concluded the funds were insufficient after having reviewed the Applicants\u2019 proof of assets and their relative\u2019s bank account statements. In light of the evidence contradictory to the Officer\u2019s findings, the Officer\u2019s assertion of having \u201creviewed all documentation\u201d rings hollow. Furthermore, contrary to the Officer\u2019s finding that the Applicants were not sufficiently financially established in India, there was evidence of property ownership in India, both residential and agricultural, worth approximately $213,357 CAD. [17] In short, the Applicants were submitting a TRV to be in Canada for a short period of 11 days. They had submitted all the relevant documents showing their financial capacity to fund the trip, their financial establishment in India, and even their extended family\u2019s willingness and ability to fund the trip, if necessary. Despite the plethora of evidence, the Officer made an unreasonable finding that there were insufficient funds for the Applicants to travel and visit Canada. In my view, the Officer had a duty to state why there were insufficient funds given that the evidence supported otherwise. This renders the Officer\u2019s decision unreasonable. VI. Certified Question [18] Counsel for each party was asked if there were any questions requiring certification. They each stated that there were no questions for certification and I concur. VII. Conclusion [19] This application for judicial review is allowed. JUDGMENT in IMM-1548-19 and IMM-1549-19 and IMM-1550-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The decision is set aside and the matter is to be returned for redetermination by a different decision-maker. There is no question to certify.

{"doc_text": " RAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAR : MC003446 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Alphonse-Antoine Bolamba (the appellant) is a citizen of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). He fears the authorities of his country, who have accused him of belonging to a group of criminals, the kuluna. He left the DRC for Angola on October 17, 2016, and then went to the United States (U.S.) in January 2017 before reaching Canada on February 14, 2017. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that the appellant was not credible due to omissions, contradictions and inconsistencies between his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form) and his testimony, and because his answers were not spontaneous and he was hesitant. It considered his story to be inconsistent with the documentary evidence on the kuluna. The appellant alleges that the RPD erred in its assessment of his credibility and the situation with respect to the kuluna. The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is whether the RPD erred in its assessment of the appellant\u2019s credibility and risk. DETERMINATION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD correctly determined that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. ANALYSIS My role is to examine all of the evidence, including reading the transcript and listening to the hearing, and to establish whether the RPD\u2019s decision is correct. Operation Likofi and the kuluna The kuluna phenomenon and Operation Likofi are central to the refugee protection claim. The appellant presented no documentary evidence before either the RPD or the RAD. I conducted a detailed analysis of the evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP). The kuluna are street gangs, members of organized criminal gangs. They are mainly young men under 20 years old, sometimes under the influence of drugs, many of whom come from \u201cpoor families\u201d. They commit robberies, rapes, and murders using machetes, bottles, knives and firearms. These gangs terrorize the residents of Kinshasa. They operate in gangs of 10 to 20 members with a leader. The \u201cgeneral coordination\u201d of the gang maintains good relations with influential administrative, political and business authorities. In November 2013, the state launched Operation Likofi against the kuluna. Operation Likofi II followed on December 15, 2013, and ended on February 15, 2014. Although the operation was well received by the public, the primary victim of insecurity at the hands of the kuluna, the methods used by the Congolese police raised a number of concerns and criticisms from MONUSCO and UNICEF in particular regarding respect for the human rights of the kuluna. The operation reportedly resulted in 51 deaths and 33 forced disappearances at the hands of law enforcement. Operation Likofi is described as follows: In raids across the city, uniformed police who had covered their faces with black masks dragged suspected kuluna at gunpoint out of their homes at night with no arrest warrants. In many cases, the police shot and killed the unarmed youth outside their homes, often in front of family members and neighbors. Others were apprehended and executed in the open markets where they slept or worked or in nearby fields or empty lots. Five of those who were killed during Operation Likofi were between the ages of 14 and 17. Many others were taken to unknown locations and forcibly disappeared. (Human Rights Watch 17 Nov. 2014, 1). Although Operation Likofi had ended in 2014, a number of organizations demanded in 2016 that the Congolese government resume its practice of hunting down the kuluna to help stabilize the DRC. The government reportedly announced the resumption of this fight and made a number of arrests in 2016. The evidence notes that complaints against the rise of the kuluna may go unanswered and that police operations may be insufficient due to a lack of personnel, sometimes making room for acts of popular justice. The appellant would not have been able to obtain a passport from the Congolese authorities if he were being sought by the police The RPD draws a negative inference with respect to the appellant\u2019s credibility due to the fact that he obtained a diplomatic passport from the country\u2019s authorities even though he was being sought by the police for his membership in the kuluna criminal group. The RPD acknowledges that the DRC authorities are very corrupt and accept bribes to issue documents to the highest bidder; however, according to the appellant\u2019s testimony, there was no exchange of bribes to obtain his diplomatic passport and he obtained it even though his sister was not yet even at her post in Luanda. The appellant asserts that he explained at the hearing that the different branches of government are corrupt and do not communicate amongst themselves. He adds that, according to the NDP, passport applicants must pay a bribe to the government in order to get their passports as quickly as possible. He states that he testified that his stepsister had taken the necessary steps to get him the diplomatic passport. The RPD\u2019s conclusion is correct. To respond to the appellant\u2019s submission, I conducted a detailed analysis of the documentary evidence relating to the procedure for obtaining a passport, diplomatic or otherwise, in the DRC. Considering each step, I do not believe, on a balance of probabilities, that a person actively being sought by the police would be able to obtain a passport issued by the Congolese authorities. To obtain a diplomatic or other passport, a person must file an application with the country\u2019s National Intelligence Agency (Agence nationale de renseignements, ANR), whose mission is to ensure the internal and external security of the state. I consider it unlikely that the ANR, the country\u2019s political police, would allow a person being actively sought by the police to obtain a passport, especially since the kuluna issue is a challenge to the country\u2019s stabilization. The person must go in person to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to have a photograph and fingerprints taken, as the appellant did. He testified that he went there with his sister, not that she took the steps on her own. The authorities took his photograph and his fingerprints. I do not believe that he would have been able to enter the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to have his fingerprints taken if the police were actively looking for him. His sister was not yet a diplomat but a mere citizen and lawyer, and the appellant did not contend that she may have used any favouritism to get the photograph and fingerprints taken. To obtain a passport, diplomatic or otherwise, a person must file different documents, including a police certificate. A police certificate is a criminal record extract issued by the Ministry of Justice that can be obtained by going [translation] \u201cin person\u201d to the nearest judiciary police station, proving one\u2019s identity and having one\u2019s fingerprints taken. I do not believe that a person actively being sought by the Congolese national police (PNC) could go to the police station, have fingerprints taken and obtain a police certificate. The appellant argues that it is possible to obtain a passport by offering a bribe. As he asserts, a bribe, according to the evidence, makes it possible to obtain a passport quickly, not to avoid an ANR check or avoid having to present a police certificate. He filed no evidence in this regard. Even if his sister had paid a bribe, there is nothing in the evidence that leads me to conclude that this would have enabled him to avoid the security services. The appellant asserts that the different state bodies do not communicate amongst themselves, which would explain how he was able to obtain a passport. I do not accept this argument. I saw nothing in the documentary evidence that would lead me to believe that the ANR would not identify a person with an active search warrant against them from the PNC or that the police would provide a police certificate to a wanted person. The appellant did not produce any. The appellant does not challenge the RPD when it considered that, if the appellant had had problems with the DRC authorities in 2014, his stepsister would not have taken the chance of compromising her posting by obtaining a diplomatic passport for the appellant in September 2015. I share the opinion of the RPD. After assessing the passport application process in the DRC, I conclude that it is unlikely that the appellant could have obtained a passport from the Congolese authorities if he were actively being sought by the police. I draw a negative inference regarding his credibility and do not believe that he was wanted by the Congolese authorities in September 2015 at the time of his passport application. The notice to appear does not corroborate the appellant\u2019s allegations that he was wanted for being a kuluna The RPD found that the appellant was not credible because he testified that he had not been personally targeted by the police, while Exhibit P4 is a notice to appear that establishes the opposite. It is of the opinion that if he had been targeted by the authorities he should have spontaneously stated this at the first opportunity. The RPD notes that the appellant indicated in his BOC Form that he received two notices from the police, on April 2014 and May 2014, but that he only submitted to the RPD one notice, not reported in his BOC Form, dated June 20, 2014. It is of the opinion that he did not make the necessary efforts to prove that he was targeted by the authorities of his country in 2014. The appellant asserts that his testimony on this aspect of his story is consistent with his BOC Form, that he produced the notice to appear to corroborate his story to the best of his abilities and that he was unable to get his hands on the other two notices to appear. In his BOC Form, the appellant indicates that his mother received a notice the day after Easter, 2014, and then a second one in May 2014 (without specifying the date). In his amendment, he corrects his BOC Form and writes: [translation] \u201cIn June 2014, my mother received a third notice, while she had received a second one in May 2014.\u201d At the hearing, he testified that he received a notice on March 15, a second one in May and the third on June 20. He explained that his mother lost the first two. The initial BOC Form only mentions two notices, while the amended BOC Form and his testimony at the hearing mention three. The appellant can correct his BOC Form before the hearing, but there is a difference between receiving two notices and three notices. While not determinative, this contradiction undermines the credibility of the appellant\u2019s allegations and adds to the claimant\u2019s other credibility issues. The appellant filed only one of the three notices to appear. This document indicates that the police summoned the appellant on June 20, 2014, to appear at the office of the OPJ on the grounds of: \u201cRENS\u201d and that it is the third notice. This notice to appear allows me to corroborate that the appellant was summoned by the police in June 2014 but does not confirm for what reason. Even if the appellant had been summoned by the police in 2014, the summons does not allow me to corroborate that it is because he was suspected of being a kuluna. Operation Likofi did happen as the appellant describes When the RPD asked him if he had been targeted by the police, the appellant said that he did not understand the question, then corrected himself and said that yes, he had been. He then explained that the police were targeting the young people in his neighbourhood. I am reproducing here the exchange with the RPD. [translation] MEMBER: Were you targeted directly by the police? CLAIMANT: Yes, yes, I was targeted. MEMBER: Tell me when and in what context. CLAIMANT: It was because, first, I was young\u2026 I was young. And second, it was\u2026 it was because of the neighbourhood where I was living, it was just a neighbourhood that was really targeted and so they weren\u2019t concerned with finding out who was a criminal and who was not. They just arrested all the young people. MEMBER: But, you know, my difficulty is that if the police had to arrest all the young people, I think that there would be\u2026 universities, colleges and high schools would be empty, they would be transformed into prisons if the authorities were arresting all the young people, as you are insinuating. Do you understand? CLAIMANT: No, no, it\u2019s not that they were going door to door, knocking and then arresting young people. It was, they might see you on your way somewhere and would come and arrest you. And when they arrested you, they would take you to unknown destinations. They even started killing young people. There were a lot of deaths. MEMBER: What was the name of your neighbourhood? CLAIMANT: Selembao. MEMBER: Selembao? CLAIMANT: Selembao. MEMBER: Selembao? CLAIMANT: Yes. MEMBER: With S E L E M B A O? CLAIMANT: Yes. MEMBER: Okay, the fact that you were young, you lived in this notorious neighbourhood. Are there any other reasons why you were targeted by the police? CLAIMANT: No, no, there is no other reason. MEMBER: So, then\u2026 CLAIMANT: And it\u2019s not that they targeted me knowing my name, my house. No, it wasn\u2019t that. It was more because of the fact that I was young. MEMBER: Okay, and did you have problems directly with the police? CLAIMANT: No, no, I never had problems. After this exchange, the appellant\u2019s counsel had a discussion with the RPD to ensure that his client understood the meaning of the word directly. The RPD then asked the appellant, [translation] \u201cSo you were not targeted by the police in your own name.\u201d The appellant responded, [translation] \u201cNo, no, I was not targeted.\u201d The RPD then showed the summons (P4) to the appellant and asked him to explain why he had stated earlier that he was not personally targeted. The appellant explained that he had done nothing, because [translation] \u201cto be targeted, you have to have done something. I know I never had problems with the police or with\u2026 with anyone at all,\u201d that like many young people, the police were after him. [translation] Yes, because\u2026 first, it was an operation that had been\u2026 that had been launched by the country\u2019s authorities. And then, it normally consisted in arresting young offenders, but there had been some confusion and blunders, they started arresting all the\u2026 the young people. The appellant argues that he had therefore allegedly had been \u201ctargeted,\u201d not for an act he may have committed personally, but as part of the PNC\u2019s Operation Likofi against members of kuluna gangs. The police allegedly attacked him because he was [translation] \u201ca young person\u201d and young people were facing arbitrary arrests. The documentary evidence corroborates how the operation happened, as I indicated at paragraph 10 of these reasons. Operation Likofi ended in 2014 When the appellant\u2019s mother received the visit from police officers, Operation Likofi (November 2013) and Operation Likofi II (December 15, 2013, to February 15, 2014) had both ended. According to the appellant\u2019s allegations, the first visit from police officers occurred at his mother\u2019s home right after the end of Operation Likofi II, on the night of Easter Monday, April 21, 2014. The other two police notices were allegedly filed nearly two weeks after Operation Likofi II, and only one was provided as evidence. The appellant did not produce any documentary evidence to show that police action continued after that date. The operation\u2019s end in 2014 is confirmed by the documentary evidence. The statistics available on the young victims of police action reported by human rights organizations refer to 2013\u20132014 (51 deaths and 33 forced disappearances). The appellant alleges that the police came to his home in March 2014, again in April 2014 and May 2014, and then arrested and imprisoned him in June 2014. However, Operation Likofi, which involved systematically hunting down kuluna, had ended on February 14, 2014. If the appellant was not being sought personally but as part of the overall operation, as he testified at the hearing, I find it difficult to understand why the authorities still would have been interested in him after Operation Likofi had ended. Even if they had done so, the documentary evidence confirms that the large-scale antikuluna operations are over. In 2016, a number of organizations requested that the Congolese government resume hunting down the kuluna to help stabilize the DRC, which implies that this operation had in fact ceased. Moreover, even if I were to admit that the police raids and the appellant\u2019s arrest took place as part of Operation Likofi in 2014, I consider that he was no longer wanted in 2015 when he obtained his passport. Furthermore, if he were to return to the DRC, there is nothing in his profile to indicate that the PNC would consider him a kuluna. The appellant does not have the profile of a kuluna After having assessed the evidence in the NDP on the kuluna, the RPD concluded that the appellant does not have the profile of a kuluna because they act as a group and come from poor communities. It concluded that it is unlikely that the police were looking for the appellant because they had reasonable grounds to believe that he was part of the kuluna. It noted that he was a fulltime student. It considers that the appellant\u2019s claim that he was targeted because he was young and because of his imputed political opinion is not supported by the documentary evidence or by his testimony. The appellant asserts that the RPD\u2019s conclusion is unreasonable because it is based on a stereotype that members of armed gangs are all from underprivileged neighbourhoods. He adds that there is a real possibility that a young man from the outskirts of Kinshasa could be targeted by police, especially if he is a fulltime student. He insists that the search for the kuluna was a pretext for going after students protesting against the ruling government. The question posed to me by the appellant is whether the police might target him because of his membership in the kuluna if he were to return to the DRC since that is the reason he is seeking Canada\u2019s protection. The kuluna are criminals. According to the documentary evidence, many are from poor families. That does not actually mean they all are. However, if the appellant were to return to the DRC in 2021, his profile does not match that of a kuluna, as I indicated at the beginning of these reasons. He would be over the age of 20 (22 years old in 2021), would still be from a family that he does not describe as [translation] \u201cpoor\u201d and would still be educated. This makes it an unlikely possibility that he would be targeted as a kuluna based on his profile if he were to return to the DRC. Even if he were, there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that the treatment contrary to their human rights that kuluna were subjected to in 2013\u20132014 during Operation Likofi is still happening in 2021. The appellant did not produce any. Although the evidence points to some connections between kuluna and politicians and indicates that some political leaders may pay the kuluna to participate in political demonstrations and inflate the number of their supporters or to sow disorder, there is nothing that leads me to think that the government used Operation Likofi to silence the political opposition. The appellant did not produce any. The appellant\u2019s error in his initial BOC Form regarding the identity of the person who hid him for nearly two years undermines his credibility The RPD notes that the appellant is not credible due to an amendment made to his story following the submission of evidence. In his BOC Form, he writes that he hid at his aunt\u2019s place after escaping from prison when he in fact amended his BOC Form to state that he was actually hiding at his uncle\u2019s place. The appellant argues that his story is dated [translation] \u201cFebruary 2013\u201d and that a long time had passed between the start of his problems and his hearing date. He adds that it is normal for him to have amended his story to include this detail. In his BOC Form, the appellant writes that after March 15, 2014, he was in hiding at the home of his aunt Solange Mumbu. in the Kimbangu neighbourhood, municipality of Kalamu, for a few weeks (lines 36 to 38). He amended his BOC Form, clarifying this aunt\u2019s real name. He explained that he went back to his studies while continuing to live with this aunt (lines 46 to 48). Police officers allegedly came to her home on the night of Easter Monday, April 21, 2014, to arrest him (lines 50 to 54). After escaping on the night of Easter Monday, April 21, 2014, he hid at the home of his aunt Solange Mumbu in Kimbangu (lines 66 to 68). He amended his BOC Form to state that it was actually his uncle Jean Roger Bujakera Bolamba. The RPD\u2019s conclusion is correct. It is true that refugee protection claimants may elaborate on certain aspects of their story, add details or clarify the evidence in amended versions of their BOC Form or even at the hearing. However, in this case, this amendment is not clarifying his story or correcting an error, but rather changing the identity of the person at whose home he allegedly went to hide when he was being sought by the police. For example, the appellant could have corrected a clerical error that might have slipped in, such as writing aunt instead of uncle. Here, he does not simply indicate that it was his uncle instead of his aunt, but he also changes the person\u2019s full name. The place where he was hiding after his escape and where he waited for about 20 months (between June 2014 and October 2016) is important to the assessment of his fear. I would then expect that when he signed his BOC form in 2017, accompanied by his legal counsel, he would not make a mistake with this person\u2019s identity. I do not see how the fact that his story took place three years before he signed his BOC Form (in 2014 and not in 2013, as he submits in his memorandum) explains why he would have made a mistake with the identity of the person who hid him for nearly two years, confusing his uncle with his aunt. This error regarding the person in the initial BOC Form undermines his credibility. It is not determinative, but it adds to the appellant\u2019s other credibility issues. The behaviour of this appellant who did not seek asylum in the United States even though he had a visa for that country and had gone there in 2016 is not consistent with that of a person who fears for his life The RPD draws a negative inference regarding the appellant\u2019s credibility based on the fact that he travelled to the U.S. without seeking asylum when he had no special status in 2016 and his status depended on his sister. It considers that if he feared for his safety in the DRC he would have applied for asylum in the U.S. in December 2016. This conclusion is not determinative. The appellant asserts that he had legal status in Angola at that time. The RPD correctly concluded that the appellant\u2019s behaviour is inconsistent with that of a person who fears for their life and that this undermined his credibility. The appellant did not have legal status in Angola when he went to the U.S. in 2016. His status in Angola was entirely dependent on the diplomatic duties of his stepsister, the latter being based on a lie since to the Congolese authorities he was his stepsister\u2019s son. He was taking a risk that the Congolese authorities would find out that he was not his stepsister\u2019s son, as the Angolan authorities discovered in 2017 when they asked him to leave the country. The appellant had had a U.S. visa since November 1, 2016, and could have applied to the U.S. for protection as of that date. He went there on vacation in November 2016. He sought Canada\u2019s protection because his life had been in danger in his country of origin since 2014. However, he returned to Angola without seeking asylum, thereby taking the risk of having the Angolan authorities ask him to leave the country, as did occur in 2017. The failure to apply for asylum in the U.S. when he had only temporary status in Angola is inconsistent with the behaviour of a person who fears being persecuted or harmed. This behaviour in itself is not determinative, but it adds to the appellant\u2019s other credibility issues. The appellant would not face a risk if he returned to the DRC The appellant is not challenging the conclusion of the RPD that it did not believe that the appellant was wanted in his country. It considered that if he had received three summonses from the police between March and June 2014, his sister, a lawyer whom the government trusted sufficiently to make her a diplomat, would have defended him by presenting him as a fulltime student and not a member of the kuluna armed criminal group rather than passing him off as her son. The appellant is not credible. He obtained a diplomatic passport in 2015 when he alleges he was being sought. He did not apply for asylum in the U.S. even though he had no legal status in Angola. He made a mistake with the identity of the person who hid him between 2014 and 2016 in his initial BOC Form. Even if he did have trouble with the police in April and June 2014, he did not establish that it was because he was suspected of being a kuluna, and Operation Likofi had ended in February 2014. The notice to appear that he produced on the RPD record does not corroborate this allegation. If the appellant were to return to the DRC, there is nothing in his profile that suggests that the police would suspect him of being a kuluna. The evidence also does not lead to the conclusion that in 2021 the kuluna are still being hunted down in a manner that violates their human rights, as was the case in 2013\u20132014. The appellant would not face a serious possibility of persecution and, on a balance of probabilities, would not be subjected to a risk to his life, to a danger of torture or to a risk of cruel and unusual punishment if he were to return to the DRC. CONCLUSION I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD\u2019s determination that the appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : MB926401 MB926402 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Elisabeth Rouzier (Principal Appellant) and her husband, Olivier Duclair (Associate Appellant), both citizens of Haiti, are appealing the negative decision rendered in their case by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on October 3, 2019. The determinative issues for the RPD with respect to the Principal Appellant were credibility, regarding her allegations of persecution for imputed political opinion in Haiti, and failure to prove forward-facing harm in her fear of return to Haiti, regarding her allegations of sexual assault. With respect to the Associate Appellant, the determinative issue was exclusion under sections 1E of the Convention and 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its findings regarding the Principal Appellant\u2019s allegations of persecution for treating the injured at political protests, because its credibility concerns were of minor issues that were adequately explained during her testimony. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its findings regarding the Principal Appellant\u2019s allegations of prospective risk resulting from her sexual assault, because it had failed to assess the objective documentary evidence regarding the situation for women who fear gender-based violence in Haiti. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in finding that the Associate Appellant was excluded, as it had erred regarding his access to permanent resident status in Brazil, that he had rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Brazil and had no viable internal flight alternative (IFA) there, and that his allegations of prospective risk in Haiti are credible. I find that the RPD did not err in its negative credibility findings regarding the Principal Appellant\u2019s allegations of persecution for imputed political opinion in Haiti. I find that the RPD did err in its findings regarding the Principal Appellant\u2019s prospective risk as a woman who was the victim of a sexual assault in Haiti, based on the objective documentary evidence when applied to her personal situation. I find that the Principal Appellant has produced credible evidence that she faces a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti based on her membership in a particular social group, namely women who fear gender-related persecution; that the presumption of adequate state protection has been rebutted; and that there is no IFA in Haiti that would be safe and reasonable for her as a victim of sexual assault who has been threatened by her attackers and the police, based on her credible personal evidence and the objective documentary evidence. I find that the RPD did not err in its finding that the Associate Appellant is excluded under sections 1E of the Convention and 98 of IRPA. DECISION The appeal is allowed for the Principal Appellant. I substitute my own decision that the Principal Appellant is a Convention refugee. The appeal is dismissed for the Associate Appellant. I confirm the determination of the RPD that the Associate Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. NEW EVIDENCE No new evidence has been provided to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) and there has been no request for an oral hearing. ROLE OF THE RAD When reviewing the RPD decision, I independently assessed the evidence, including listening to the audio recording of the RPD hearings of September 5th and 20th, 2019, and reviewing the transcripts of the hearings, to determine whether or not the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law, of fact, or of mixed law and fact. ANALYSIS I will first assess the RPD\u2019s finding that the Principal Appellant is not excluded under sections 1E of the Convention and 98 of IRPA, before conducting an analysis of the Principal Appellant\u2019s credibility regarding her allegations of persecution in Haiti due to her imputed political opinion; then consider the Principal Appellant\u2019s prospective risk in Haiti due to her credible sexual assault allegations; and, finally, assess the 1E exclusion of the Associate Appellant. RPD\u2019s finding that the Principal Appellant is not excluded under 1E of Convention The RPD found that the Principal Appellant was not excluded for her right of permanent residence in Brazil, as indicated in the Brazilian visa in her passport, because the rights and conditions attached to that visa meant that her status was not substantially similar to that of its nationals. The Appellants did not contest this finding. When assessing the evidence, I am in agreement with the finding of the RPD in this regard. The RPD had determined that the Principal Appellant\u2019s status in Brazil was precarious, rather than permanent, due to the requirement that she be employed in order to maintain her status. This requirement is indicated in the objective documentary evidence regarding the conditions attached to her Brazilian visa. In considering the interpretation of \u201cthe rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality\u201d of the country of residence as set out in Shamlou, the requirement to work as a condition of maintaining one\u2019s status has been found to constitute a precarious status, rather than a permanent one, as discussed in Alsha\u2019bi . In applying the test in Zeng, I find that the Principal Appellant therefore did not have status that was substantially similar to that of nationals on the date of the hearing, nor did she previously have such status and lose it, nor did she have access to it and fail to acquire it, because of the nature of the status that was attached to her visa. When considering the particular situation of the Principal Appellant, whose status was dependent on having a job in Brazil, the RPD finding is therefore correct. I conclude that the Principal Appellant is not excluded under sections 1E of the Convention and 98 of IRPA. Credibility of Principal Appellant regarding fear of return to Haiti because of imputed political opinion The RPD found that the Principal Appellant was not credible regarding her allegations of being targeted for her voluntary work as a nurse who treated the injured at protests in Haiti, due to important contradictions, inconsistencies and omissions between her Basis of Claim (BOC) form and testimony, as well as contradictions within her testimony, that were not adequately explained. The Appellants argue that any problems with the Principal Appellant\u2019s testimony or BOC were minor and that the RPD failed to consider Haitian culture and widespread problems with documents in Haiti, which meant that the RPD should not have used any contradictions or omissions between a document and her testimony or BOC against her in determining her credibility. I find that, as discussed below, the credibility problems that had been raised by the RPD were not minor, in fact, they were at the core of the Principal Appellant\u2019s allegations, and that the explanations provided were themselves incoherent and contradictory, therefore far from satisfactory. I agree that this undermined her credibility regarding her allegations of persecution for treating the injured at political protests. I find that the documentary evidence provided by the Principal Appellant, including her BOC form, her birth certificate and marriage certificate do not address these credibility concerns or outweigh them as corroborative evidence. Omissions and contradictions regarding alleged agent of persecution The RPD found that the Principal Appellant\u2019s credibility was undermined because she had not indicated in her BOC or testified at her first opportunity that she feared Jean-Baptiste Laforest and that he had threatened her with death, only mentioning this later during the hearing. The RPD also found that the allegations of the Principal Appellant during her testimony regarding Jean-Baptiste Laforest contradicted allegations in her BOC. While the Appellants did not contest the initial omission in her testimony, or that there were contradictions between the testimony and the BOC, they argue that these were not important. During the hearing, the Principal Appellant was asked who she fears if she were to return to Haiti and she answered that she feared the bandits who had sexually assaulted her and Paulette Bouchereau. Specifically, she referred to the three bandits who had broken into her home and said that they would kill her if she were to return to Haiti. When asked if she feared anyone else in Haiti, she answered, \u201cPierre Vastey\u201d. About fifteen minutes later, the Principal Appellant testified that Jean-Baptiste Laforest and Pierre Vastey had threatened her for treating people who were injured at the protests, that they had \u201crisen up\u201d against her. In her BOC, the Principal Appellant had not identified Jean-Baptiste Laforest as an agent of persecution. To the contrary, she had written that he was her cousin, that he was a member of the opposition, and that she had attended closed-door meetings with him, during which he had encouraged her to fight against the regime in place, which was described as corrupt and responsible for causing the suffering of Haitians. The Principal Appellant had also written that Jean-Baptiste Laforest was an enemy of Pierre Vastey, who was an advisor to the government in power at the time, and that a member of Pierre Vastey\u2019s entourage had threatened her with death. There was no mention in her BOC of any threats from Jean-Baptiste Laforest or that he had joined Pierre Vastey in threatening her. When given the opportunity at the beginning of the hearing to add information that had been omitted from the BOC, she did not do so. One version is thus provided in the Principal Appellant\u2019s BOC of Jean-Baptiste Laforest as someone who was a family member that had encouraged her to rise up against the government in power, with whom she had attended closed-door meetings during which political activism was discussed, who was a member of the opposition, and who was specifically an enemy of Pierre Vastey. This is a complete contradiction to the version provided by the Principal Appellant during the hearing, when she testified that Jean-Baptiste Laforest and Pierre Vastey had both threatened her and both did not want her to help the injured at protests. When given the opportunity to explain this contradiction, she answered that when she prepared her BOC, she had been under stress and therefore had not written everything in her BOC. The Principal Appellant was also asked to explain why, during the hearing, she had testified that Jean-Baptiste Laforest and Pierre Vastey had held a meeting together during which they had threatened her, which was not in her BOC, and which seemed inconsistent with the information she had given in her BOC, that the two men were enemies and that it would seem unusual for them to hold a meeting together where she was asked to attend. She answered that in Haiti, if it was \u201cthis type of meeting\u201d, then both men would have attended, without explaining the type of meeting to which she had been referring. When I consider the contradictions and omission regarding the people who she alleges had targeted her for treating people at the protests, I find that they are important and that the RPD did not err in its negative credibility finding. The notion of who the Principal Appellant fears is at the heart of her claim, and I consider that she did not provide satisfactory explanations as to why there were contradictions between the allegations about the agents of persecution in the BOC and her testimony. I find these two versions to be irreconcilable, and the Principal Appellant\u2019s explanation of being stressed does not address the existence of two completely different versions. It is one thing to say that you have omitted a specific detail due to stress and quite another to say that you have created two completely different versions of the same story due to stress, which I consider is a situation that calls into question the credibility of the allegations. Contradictions regarding treatment of injured at protests The RPD found that the Principal Appellant was not credible due to the contradictions and evolution of her allegations that she had been targeted due to her providing treatment to people who had been injured at the protests. The Appellants do not contest that the Principal Appellant\u2019s testimony contained contradictions but argue that she provided reasonable explanations and that the contradictions were not so significant as to undermine her credibility. The Principal Appellant wrote in her BOC that during the 2013 political protests, there had been lots of injured people who did not want to go to the doctor and that she had provided them with nursing care outside a hospital in St. Marc. She added in her written narrative that she volunteered \u201cso as to avoid the death of the protesters who had been injured and were afraid to go to the hospital so as to avoid being arrested.\u201d Furthermore, she wrote that she \u201ctreated them with staff of the opposition, because her cousin had been a member of the opposition\u201d and had told her to always fight the regime in power. The fact that the people she allegedly treated were protesters was thus clearly indicated in her BOC narrative. During the hearing, the Principal Appellant at first testified that she had treated protesters, which led to her being targeted for death. When she was asked why Jean-Baptiste Laforest would have threatened her for helping protesters, when he was allegedly the one who had told her to rise up against the government, she answered that the people that she had treated were in fact not protesters. She said that she was treating people who were passersby or merchants who owned shops in the area of the protests. When she was asked to explain this contradiction, the Principal Appellant replied that in Haiti, when a person is injured during a protest, that person will be referred to as a protester. I find that the explanation of the Principal Appellant is not satisfactory. Once again, she is presenting two completely different versions of the same story: the one, in which she is allied with the protesters and helping them because they do not want to go to a hospital to seek medical treatment; the other, that she is treating passersby who were not involved in the protest. However, her answer as to why Jean-Baptiste Laforest would have objected to her treating protesters, when she said that she was not treating protesters but people who just happened to be in the vicinity of the protest, does not explain the contradiction regarding Jean-Baptiste Laforest and also creates a further contradiction to the specific allegations in her written BOC, that she had to help the protesters because they were afraid that they would be arrested if they sought treatment after the protests at the hospital. I therefore find that the RPD did not err and that this represents significant problems at the core of the Principal Appellant\u2019s allegations that undermine her credibility. Threats by police because of treatment of injured at protests The RPD found that the Principal Appellant was not credible in her allegations that she had been threatened by police due to contradictions between her testimony and BOC, and omissions in her BOC of allegations that were in her testimony. The Appellants do not contest the contradictions and omissions referred to in the RPD\u2019s decision but argue that they were reasonably explained by the Principal Appellant and that they were not significant. At the RPD hearing, the Principal Appellant initially testified that she had not been threatened by the Haitian police, which contradicted the written narrative in her BOC wherein she had alleged that she had been threatened by police for her involvement in helping people who had been beaten by police at protests. When asked to explain this contradiction, the Principal Appellant at first replied that when she went to police to file a complaint against the bandits for the sexual assault, the police had told her to leave the police station or they would call the bandits. The RPD then asked a second time if she had been threatened by the police, and she said that she had. When asked to explain the contradiction, she said that it was the way she had been asked the question at the hearing. When then asked to explain this omission from her BOC, her answer was that she had been stressed and that she had thought that she had written it. The RPD found that this explanation was unsatisfactory and that it pertained to an important omission. The Principal Appellant\u2019s description in her BOC of her visit to the police station after the sexual assault includes a reference to some rude remarks that the police had made and alleges that they had said that it would be impossible to follow up because the bandits had been masked. There was no mention of them threatening to call the bandits if she did not leave. When I consider the nature of this omission, I do not think that it is a material omission, but rather an omission of a detail. The Principal Appellant had included in her BOC specific, rude statements that the officers had made to her, after telling her that they could not follow up on the investigation. Such remarks included that the Principal Appellant thought that she was the Queen of St. Marc, as well as an expression stating that water that might appear to be clear could be dirty, which appears to be a derogatory comment against her integrity. This allegation is corroborated by the objective documentary evidence, as discussed below, that police officers are often dismissive of women\u2019s attempts to file a complaint about sexual assault and that they tend to refuse to investigate sexual assaults committed by masked or unidentified individuals, even though they are supposed to investigate such complaints. Rather than undermining her credibility, I think that her testimony about what the officers told her at the police station is consistent with the allegation that they treated her rudely and refused to hear her complaint. I find that the omission from the BOC narrative of the threat by police when she visited the station to report the sexual assault and they wanted her to leave, does not undermine her credibility regarding her allegation of a lack of state protection by the Haitian police. In that context, I find that she has put forward credible evidence that the police refused to help her, were rude to her in her attempt to file a complaint about a sexual assault, and threatened to contact her aggressors if she did not leave. I do think that the Principal Appellant has established, on the balance of probabilities, that the police threatened to call the bandits if she did not leave the police station when she attempted to file a complaint about the sexual assault. I therefore find that the RPD erred in its conclusion that the Principal Appellant was not threatened by police. The RPD made no negative credibility findings regarding the allegation of police refusal to help the Principal Appellant in her complaint for sexual assault, and after reviewing the evidence, I find her credible in this regard as well. I do not think that the Principal Appellant has established, on the balance of probabilities, that this threat by the police was linked to her alleged treatment of the injured at political protests. I consider that on the balance of probabilities, this threat was linked to her trying to file a police complaint for sexual assault. Conclusion regarding credibility of Principal Appellant regarding fear of return to Haiti because of imputed political opinion I find that the RPD was correct in its negative credibility findings regarding the omissions and contradictions about one of the agents of persecution; the contradictions regarding the treatment of injured at protests; and the omissions and contradictions regarding the threats by police connected to her treatment of the injured at protests. I find that the RPD erred in its negative credibility finding that the Principal Appellant was not threatened by police. Principal Appellant\u2019s fear of return to Haiti as a woman who fears gender-based violence I have applied the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4 \u2013 Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (the Guideline) in my analysis. The RPD raised no negative credibility findings regarding the Principal Appellant\u2019s allegations that she had been sexually assaulted in Haiti in August 2013, but found that she had not put forth enough elements of proof to establish the objective basis of her claim of a fear of return to Haiti. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in finding that she had not proven the objective basis of her claim, because it had failed to take into account the relevant objective documentary evidence, particularly the absence of adequate state protection for victims of gender-based violence in Haiti, that it had not properly applied Guideline 4 regarding women who fear gender-based violence and that it had erred in concluding that she did not have the profile of a vulnerable woman. I find that the RPD erred in its application of Guideline 4, specifically in failing to consider the objective documentary evidence regarding women who fear gender-based violence in Haiti, when assessing the personal situation of the Principal Appellant. As a result, the RPD erred in its conclusion that the Principal Appellant does not meet the profile of a vulnerable woman and that she does not face a prospective risk in Haiti. Consequently, the RPD also erred in not assessing state protection for the Principal Appellant. According to the \u201cFramework of Analysis\u201d set out in the Guideline, the determination as to whether or not the Principal Appellant\u2019s fear of persecution is well-founded \u201cincludes an assessment of the evidence related to the ability or willingness of the state to protect the claimant and, more generally, the objective basis of the claim\u201d. The analysis of state protection is triggered only once it is established that there is forward-facing harm, therefore it must first be established if the Principal Appellant faces forward-facing harm if she were to return to Haiti. I agree that the RPD erred in not including an analysis of the objective documentary evidence regarding women who fear gender-based violence in Haiti before reaching its conclusions. I consider that in order to assess if the Principal Appellant has an objective basis for her fear of return to Haiti, her particular situation must be examined against the backdrop of the country conditions. The Appellants specifically made reference in their memorandum to country conditions that include widespread violence against women, the difficulties for women who try to bring charges against those who commit sexual assault, including public reproach and threats, and a lack of justice for women who have been victims of sexual assault, despite some progress. In addition, I carefully examined the objective documentary evidence regarding the situation of women who fear gender-based violence in Haiti. It indicates that sexual violence against women is a widespread problem in Haiti; there is no legislation in Haiti that prohibits violence against women, although there has been a proposal; rape was criminalized in Haiti in 2005 but is not defined in the legislation; 24% of women who have been subjected to violence in Haiti sought help from people in their milieu, while only 11% went to police; sexual violence is often not reported in Haiti and leads to the stigmatization of its victims in society; there is an absence of legal aid services for women in financial need, combined with the complexity of procedures and exclusive use of the French language in the legal system, when most of the population speaks only Creole, which contributes to the difficulties that women face in accessing the legal system; it is also often requested that sexual assault victims present a medical certificate declaring the assault to a judge, which must be co-signed by several doctors, who have different requirements and provide differing levels of information in the certificates, which are complicated to obtain; there is a documented lack of sensitivity towards victims of sexual assault by the mostly male police force, which is 91% male; it is also reported that most police officers are not adequately trained and face a lack of resources to deal with sexual assault victims; while two organizations were created to handle gender-based issues within the Haitian National Police, their actions are limited by a lack of coordination, and training of police regarding sexual violence was limited by a lack of resources that would allow for an improvement in the way victims are treated and reports made; there is no national database in Haiti on reports of sexual harassment or violence against women; victims of sexual assault also have trouble accessing the legal system because of the corruption and dysfunction of the Haitian legal system in general; also, the widespread impunity of the aggressors is documented; impunity for violence against women is said to cross all social classes, such that even women who ostensibly occupy positions of power in Haiti are subjected to gender-based violence that is not adequately addressed by the legal system; women who have been the victims of gender-based violence are more likely to be revictimized; although the number of prosecutions for sexual assault has risen since 2010, there is an overall low rate of prosecution based on a lack of court and police resources; and police often refuse to register a complaint of sexual assault against unidentified aggressors, even though under Haitian law a complaint can be registered against an unidentified individual. The RPD found that the Principal Appellant\u2019s testimony regarding the sexual assault revealed no contradictions, omissions or inconsistencies and I did not either. Therefore, the analysis is being made with the sexual assault as being credible. Furthermore, the RPD did not raise any negative credibility concerns regarding the allegations of the Principal Appellant that she had been threatened with death by the bandits who had sexually assaulted her, or that the Haitian police had refused to take her complaint of sexual assault. After reviewing the evidence, I find the Principal Appellant credible regarding these allegations. I find that the personal profile of the Principal Appellant with respect to whether or not she is vulnerable as a woman in Haiti must be assessed in light of the actual situation as described in the documentary evidence and her personal situation. I consider that it is an oversimplification to find that just because a woman is married, has male relatives in Haiti and has some education and work training, that they are somehow not vulnerable and do not face a prospective risk in Haiti. While perhaps she is not as vulnerable as would be a homeless woman who is single without a family or educational background, I find nonetheless that the evidence establishes that she faces a prospective risk. The fact remains, as indicated in the national documentation package (NDP), that women of all backgrounds, regardless of family situation or social status, are vulnerable to gender-based violence and are met with the same stigma in the community, disdain from state authorities and risk of revictimization. As indicated in the Guideline, an assessment of a gender-related claim must include whether or not the evidence demonstrates that: \u2026what the claimant genuinely fears is persecution for a Convention reason as distinguished from random violence or random criminal activity perpetrated against her as an individual. The central factor in such an assessment is, of course, the claimant\u2019s particular circumstances in relation to both the general human rights record of her country of origin and the experiences of other similarly situated women. In the case of the Principal Appellant, she in fact was living with male relatives when the sexual assault occurred, they happened to be out of the house at the time. So to say that if she is married, then she is not vulnerable, I find is an error in her particular situation, as she provided credible evidence that she was sexually assaulted, that she was threatened by her attackers, that they told her not to file a complaint or they would kill her, that the police refused to help her and also threatened to call her attackers. When this is considered against the backdrop of the country conditions as described above, I find that the RPD erred and the Principal Appellant faces a prospective risk if she were to return to Haiti. Conclusion regarding Principal Appellant\u2019s prospective risk in Haiti due to gender-based violence I conclude that the RPD erred in finding that she failed to prove the objective basis of her subjective fear of return to Haiti, regarding her credible allegations of sexual assault. Principal Appellant \u2014 Nexus to the Convention As the allegations of the Principal Appellant give rise to the serious possibility of persecution based on her membership in a particular social group, namely women who fear gender-based violence, there is a nexus to the Convention. I shall therefore examine the allegations in light of section 96 of IRPA. I find that the Principal Appellant has provided credible evidence that on the balance of probabilities, she is a victim of sexual assault; that she was threatened with death by those who participated in the sexual assault; that she went to the police to file a sexual assault complaint but they refused to help her and threatened to contact her assailants if she did not leave the police station; that as a victim of sexual assault who has been threatened by her attackers and the police, she faces prospective harm if she were to return to Haiti. The personal and objective documentary evidence of the Principal Appellant demonstrates that she faces the serious possibility of persecution if she were to return to Haiti, based on her membership in a particular social group, namely women who fear gender-based violence. For all the reasons outlined above, I find that the Principal Appellant is credible. She has established that she is subjectively fearful and that her fear is objectively well-founded and forward-facing. Principal Appellant \u2014 State protection After assessing the personal and objective documentary evidence of the Principal Appellant, I find that she has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection with clear and convincing evidence, that if she were to seek state protection, the authorities of Haiti would be unwilling or unable to provide it. The Principal Appellant has provided credible allegations that she was sexually assaulted in 2013 and threatened, that she tried to file a police complaint but that the police refused to do so and threatened to communicate with her attackers if she did not leave. Guideline 4 indicates that the main factor when assessing the evidence of women who fear gender-based violence is that woman\u2019s particular situation \u201cin relation to both the general human rights record of her country of origin and the experiences of other similarly situated women\u201d. Included in this consideration should be the availability of adequate state protection. The updated objective documentary evidence for Haiti demonstrates the ongoing problems for women who have been victims of sexual assault in Haiti when they try to seek state protection: the lack of adequate protection and the social stigma. The Principal Appellant\u2019s allegations are corroborated extensively by the NDP that documents widespread police corruption and a lack of training and resources, in addition to the fact that revictimization of women is commonplace and that the Ministry responsible for the prevention of violence against women is consistently underfunded and is threatened that its mandate will be terminated with each change of government. Principal Appellant \u2014 IFA I find that, on the balance of probabilities, given the credible testimony by the Principal Appellant regarding the sexual assault in 2013; the threats of death against the Principal Appellant by the attackers; the fact that the police threatened her and refused to file a report against her attackers; the situation for women in Haiti who have been the victims of sexual assault, that they are more likely to be revictimized and are stigmatized; as well as the lack of adequate state protection in Haiti for the Principal Appellant; that the agents of persecution who committed the sexual assault, who are unknown to the Principal Appellant and unidentified to her, threatened to kill her if she went to police; combined with the police who threatened to tell her attackers if she did not leave the station, puts the Principal Appellant in a situation that is more than a mere possibility of persecution; I find that due to the credible threats by the attackers and the police to inform her attackers, combined with the lack of adequate state protection, would provide the agents of harm, which includes the police, with the means and motivation to find and harm the Principal Appellant throughout Haiti and that, as a result, there is nowhere in Haiti that would be safe for her to relocate. The problems outlined in the updated country conditions for Haiti demonstrate that the lack of adequate state protection, combined with the situation of women in Haiti who have been victims of sexual assault, lead me to conclude that the Principal Appellant would face the serious possibility of persecution throughout Haiti. As the first prong of the IFA test of safety has not been met, there is no need to assess the second prong of reasonableness. Conclusion regarding Principal Appellant I find that the Principal Appellant faces the serious possibility of persecution if she were to return to Haiti, based on her membership in a particular social group, namely women who fear gender-based violence. I therefore conclude that the Principal Appellant is a Convention refugee. 1E Exclusion of the Associate Appellant The RPD found that the Associate Appellant was excluded because he had access to status equivalent to that of a national of Brazil but had failed to acquire it, that his loss of status was voluntary; that he had not rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Brazil because he had failed to seek any police assistance and that he had a viable IFA in Brazil; that he was not credible with respect to his allegations of prospective risk in Haiti; such that Canada\u2019s international obligations with respect to refugee protection would not be violated if the Associate Appellant were excluded under 1E of the Convention. The Appellants argue that the Associate Appellant was unaware of his access to permanent resident status in Brazil, therefore could not be faulted for failing to acquire status there; that his loss of status was involuntary, as he was forced to leave due to attacks and threats in Brazil; that he has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection for his prospective risk in Brazil; that he has no viable IFA in Brazil; that the RPD erred in not properly assessing his prospective risk in Brazil; that he could not return to Brazil; that his allegations of prospective risk in Haiti are credible; and that the RPD erred in its analysis such that Canada\u2019s international obligations would require that he not be excluded under sections 1E of the Convention and 98 of IRPA. When weighing the factors outlined in Zeng v. Canada, I find that the RPD did not err in its findings that the Associate Appellant is excluded under sections 1E of the Convention and 98 of IRPA, for the reasons listed below. Associate Appellant\u2019s access to status in Brazil and failure to acquire it The RPD found that the Associate Appellant had access to status equivalent to that of a national of Brazil, but had failed to acquire it, as his name was on the list of Haitians with access to permanent resident status, which it found was a status that was substantially similar to that of nationals. The Appellants argue that the Associate Appellant was not aware of his access to status as a Haitian resident of Brazil, as he had last checked the list of such individuals in 2015, at which time his name had not yet been added to the list. As he had not checked his status since that date, he was unaware that his name had later been added to the list, and could therefore not be faulted for having failed to acquire the status available to him. I consider that if the Associate Appellant had known to check once in order to verify if his name was on the list, then he was aware of his possible access to a stable status in Brazil and his explanation as to why he did not, that he was too busy working, is inadequate when one considers that, if he were truly facing a risk to his life in Haiti, he would want to stabilize his status in Brazil and this would have been a priority for him. Whether loss of status in Brazil was voluntary or involuntary The RPD found that his loss of status was voluntary because he did not take the necessary steps to obtain status, and chose to leave rather than seeking state protection and relocating within Brazil. The Appellants argue that his loss of status was involuntary, as he was forced to leave due to attacks and threats in Brazil and that the RPD erred in not properly assessing his prospective risk in Brazil. I find that his loss of status was voluntary, in that he chose to leave after having checked one time while knowing that there existed the possibility for his name to be added to the list of those eligible for permanent resident status in Brazil, and that even though, as discussed below, he provided credible evidence that he had been attacked and threatened in Brazil, the fact that he did not even attempt to relocate within the country and simply left, does not establish that he was forced to leave such that it could be considered an involuntary departure. Credibility of allegations regarding threats and attacks in Brazil The RPD did not make any negative credibility findings regarding the allegations of the Associate Appellant with respect to the threats and attacks that he suffered from three men who had targeted him in Sao Paolo. After reviewing the evidence, I have no reason to impugn his credibility for these allegations. That being said, I also find that the evidence put forward was somewhat limited, in that it consists of his testimony that three armed individuals, who had worked and lived in his neighbourhood in Sao Paolo, had attacked him on several occasions in February 2016, including an incident during which they stole his belongings, telling him that they do not want people of colour in that neighbourhood, and that he had reason to believe that they had killed others. In his BOC, there was a brief mention that Brazilians had started to make life hard without any further elaboration. There was no other evidence put forward regarding these allegations. Adequate state protection The RPD found that the Associate Appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection in Brazil, because he had not sought the help of police, despite his allegations that three men in his neighbourhood had attacked and threatened him multiple times. During the hearing, the Associate Appellant had testified that he had not gone to police because he believed that the men would know that he had done so and he feared that they would kill him in retaliation. The Appellants argued that the Associate Appellant\u2019s failure to seek state protection was not something that should have been used to impugn his allegations of lack of state protection, because of the objective documentary proof that demonstrates the systemic discrimination by Brazilian authorities against Haitians who file complaints, as well as the corruption of state authorities. After considering the objective documentary evidence, while I find that the discrimination against people of Afro-Caribbean descent by Brazilian authorities is well-documented, the Associate Appellant did not make proof of how this applies to his particular situation and prevents him personally from receiving adequate state protection. I therefore find that the RPD has not erred in this regard. While the Associate Appellant explained during the hearing that his reason for not seeking help was because he was afraid that his attackers would find out and kill him, he did not provide evidence of a lack of state protection in his set of circumstances and therefore did not rebut the presumption. Viable IFA in Brazil The RPD found that the Associate Appellant had a viable IFA in Brazil in Santa Catalina, as he had failed to show, on a balance of probabilities, that his alleged attackers would have the means and motivation to find him there. The Appellants argue that the Associate Appellant would not be able to relocate anywhere in Brazil because of the serious possibility of persecution that he would face based on his race and Haitian nationality, due to the country conditions involving systemic discrimination by Brazilian authorities. While I find that there is evidence of problems with state protection for those of Haitian nationality in general, I do not find that this necessarily equates with the lack of a viable IFA in the particular situation of the Associate Appellant, which requires proof of the means and motivation of the agents of harm to find and harm the Associate Appellant. Here, the Associate Appellant had testified that he believed that his attackers would be able to find him if he were to try to relocate in Brazil, because they had killed others in the zone in which they lived. When asked how they would be able to find him in a different zone, his answer was that, if they wanted to kill him, they would find him, as it was their country and they could find him anywhere. I consider these answers to be very general and not adequate to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the agents of harm would have the interest or capacity to find him, if he were to relocate to Santa Catalina. Absent any other proof regarding the interest or ability of the agents of harm, I find that the Associate Appellant has not met his burden in this regard. I find that the RPD did not err in its conclusion that the Associate Appellant has a viable IFA in Santa Catalina. Prospective risk in Brazil When I consider the evidence put forward regarding the threats and attacks that the Associate Appellant suffered in Brazil, in terms of assessing the risk that he would face in the country of residence, I find that they are not adequate to establish an objective basis of forward-facing harm. If I consider that his credible allegations are such that three armed individuals attacked him on three occasions in the same neighbourhood in Sao Paolo in February 2016, I do not consider that this establishes either a serious possibility of persecution or a risk to his life that is personal and one that is not generally faced by others, in Brazil. Whether Associate Appellant could return to Brazil The RPD found that the Associate Appellant could not return to Brazil, as he only had a temporary resident status there on his date of departure of Thursday, March 25, 2016, which did not allow him to return. The Appellants did not contest this finding. After reviewing the evidence, I find this conclusion to be correct. Not credible for prospective risk in Haiti The RPD found that the Associate Appellant was not credible regarding his allegations of prospective risk in Haiti, specifically with respect to death threats from an agent of harm there, an alleged assassination attempt against him, research for him by the Haitian police, a connection between an attack on his uncle and the threat to the Associate Appellant, and a connection between the assassination of his brother and the threat to the Associate Appellant. (i)Death threats from agent of harm in Haiti on Tuesday, April 8, 2013 The RPD found that the Associate Appellant was not credible in his allegations that he had received death threats in Haiti, further to a musical performance during which he sang politically motivated songs in June 2013, due to omissions in his BOC. The Appellants do not argue that these omissions took place but submit that the Associate Appellant\u2019s explanations for the omissions are satisfactory. During his testimony, the Associate Appellant had alleged that Pierre Valey had threatened him publicly with death immediately after his performance at the Tuesday, April 8, 2013, carnival, by threatening to follow him home and kill his family in front of him and burn their house. This allegation was not in his BOC. When asked to explain the omission, the Associate Appellant had answered that even though the full allegation had not been in the BOC, that the name of Pierre Valey had been included, in the context of an allegation that Alyans Party aides had made threats against him the day after the carnival. When I consider the nature of the omission, I find that it is significant. The fact that an agent of harm publicly threatened him with death, immediately after his musical performance, seems like a major allegation to omit, especially when taking into account that the Associate Appellant had produced additional information in a narrative prior to the hearing, which also omits this allegation. I think that an explanation should adequately address this omission in order to be satisfactory, with a more stringent requirement than if it were a small detail, for example. I therefore consider that the explanation of the Associate Appellant, that the name appeared in the BOC, is not satisfactory as to address this significant omission. I find that the RPD did not err in its finding that the Associate Appellant\u2019s credibility was undermined regarding this allegation. (ii) Assassination attempt on Wednesday, April 9, 2013 The RPD found that the Associate Appellant was not credible in his allegation that there was an assassination attempt made against him in April 2013 in Haiti, because of omissions in his BOC, contradictions between his testimony and his BOC, and contradictions between his testimony and documentary evidence. The Appellants do not argue that these omissions and contradictions took place, but argue that the Associate Appellant\u2019s explanations were satisfactory and that the RPD erred in using the contents of the Haitian documents to impugn the Associate Appellant\u2019s credibility. During his testimony on the first day of the hearing, September 5, 2019, the Associate Appellant had stated that the bandits had tried to kill him on Wednesday, April 9, 2013, and then again on April 11, 2013. The second attempt had not been mentioned in his BOC. When asked to explain the omission, the Associate Appellant had answered that it had been a mistake. On the second day of the hearing, September 20, 2019, the Associate Appellant was asked why he had written in his BOC that he had gone into hiding after the attack of April 9, 2013, but that during his testimony on the first day of the hearing, he had testified that he had been in his house on April 11, 2013, during the second attempt on his life. His answer was that he had stayed in his house because he had not thought that the bandits would return to attack him. When asked again to explain why the Friday, April 11, 2013, attack had been omitted from the BOC, he answered that he had included it in the BOC, then answered that it was indicated in his documentary evidence, specifically Exhibit P6. Exhibit P6 actually refers to one incident that took place overnight between the 9th and 10th of April 2013. When asked during the hearing to then explain why this document did not mention two different attacks, the Associate Appellant answered that it was possibly a mistake. I consider the nature of the omission and contradictions to be quite substantial, it is one thing to allege one attempt on his life, but the Associate Appellant then alleged that there had been two attempts on his life during his testimony. This significant difference requires a satisfactory explanation, but in this case, the Associate Appellant further contradicted himself, and then pointed to his documentary evidence to say that the second attempt was indicated, when in fact it was not. Exhibit P6 is a report of allegations that the Associate Appellant had himself made to the authorities. When looked at closely, it mentions that on the night of Wednesday, April 9 to Thursday, April 10, unidentified individuals had come to his house to kill him, but that he had managed to escape. Nowhere does it indicate that there were two different incidents, in fact, it seems to clearly indicate that one incident happened overnight. When considering the Appellants\u2019 argument that the information in the document should not be used against the Associate Appellant, because of the sometimes unreliable nature of Haitian documents, I must also consider that the Associate Appellant himself had referred to this document as containing the information. Furthermore, his allegation during testimony that there had been two different attempts on his life at his home was contradicted by his written allegation that he had gone into hiding immediately after the first attempt, a contradiction that was not satisfactorily explained. I therefore find that rather than providing an adequate explanation, his answers evolved to create further contradictions within the evidence and his credibility was undermined. I find that the RPD did not err in its findings in this regard. (iii) Research for Associate Appellant by police The RPD found that the Associate Appellant was not credible in his allegation that the Haitian police were looking for him \u201ceverywhere\u201d as written in his BOC, after he testified as to only one occasion when the police seemed to be looking for him and could not provide further evidence in this regard. The Appellants argue that his testimony was satisfactory in establishing this allegation. When I consider the testimony that the Associate Appellant provided regarding this allegation, it consists of one incident, about two days after his singing performance at the carnival, when police had spoken to his downstairs neighbour and asked if she knew him. When asked if he had other examples of the police looking for him, he said that he did not, but that it was possible that they had gone elsewhere to look for him. I do not find that this constitutes adequate evidence, on the balance of probabilities, that the police are engaging in an exhaustive search for him, as alleged in his BOC. I find that the RPD did not err in this finding. (iv) Attack on Associate Appellant\u2019s uncle in 2017 The RPD found that the Associate Appellant had not established that an attack on his uncle in Haiti in 2017 was because the bandits were looking for the Associate Appellant, considering that his testimony was purely speculative in this regard. The Appellants did not provide any arguments regarding this finding. After reviewing the testimony, I do not consider that the Associate Appellant established on the balance of probabilities, that an alleged 2017 attack on his uncle was connected to bandits looking for him in Haiti. He testified that he had continued to make songs about the political situation in Haiti after he had arrived in Canada, and that it was why he believed the bandits were continuing to look for him and his family. I find that, absent any other evidence put forward, this allegation has not been established by the Associate Appellant. I therefore find that the RPD did not err in this regard. (v) Assassination of Associate Appellant\u2019s brother in Haiti in 2019 The RPD found that the Associate Appellant was not credible in his allegation that the reason for his brother\u2019s death in 2019 was that his family had been targeted because of the Associate Appellant\u2019s anti-government messages in his music, due to omissions in the documentary evidence and a lack of proof beyond his testimony. The Appellants argue that the documents from Haiti should not be used to impugn the credibility of the Associate Appellant as they themselves are unreliable and that he had provided adequate proof that his family had been targeted due to the political messages in his songs. The Associate Appellant had alleged in his BOC and testimony that his younger brother, Yves Duclair, had been killed in November 2019 as the family had been targeted due to the political messages in his songs. The Associate Appellant provided the act of death of his late brother, a certificate from the funeral home, and a document from 2019 wherein the Associate Appellant\u2019s mother provided a statement to authorities that the Associate Appellant had left Haiti in 2013 under threat from government supporters after his musical performance during the Carnaval wherein he criticized the government, survived an assassination attempt the night of Tuesday to Wednesday April 2013, and that his attackers had come to kill his brother because they could not find him. The RPD had considered that Exhibit P7 omitted a declaration from the cousin, who the Associate Appellant had alleged had been present and witnessed the death of his brother, regarding what had happened. The RPD also questioned why the cousin had not produced a letter to describe what he had heard. The Associate Appellant had testified that the cousin had heard the bandits say that they would persecute the whole family for his songs, during the killing of his brother. The Associate Appellant\u2019s answer did not explain why this had not been included, but said that he had provided all the documents regarding this incident. When I consider the testimony and the exhibits, I consider that the Associate Appellant has proven, on the balance of probabilities, that his brother was unfortunately killed in November 2019, and that his mother apparently believed that it was tied to the political messages in his music. I don\u2019t find that his evidence establishes, on the balance of probabilities, that there was a connection between his brother\u2019s death and the political messages in his music, or that his brother was targeted because of the Associate Appellant. I therefore find that the RPD did not err in its findings in this regard. Conclusion regarding prospective risk in Haiti I find that the RPD did not err in finding that the Associate Appellant was not credible in his allegations of prospective risk in Haiti. Canada\u2019s international obligations The RPD found that it would not be a violation of Canada\u2019s international obligations regarding refugee protection if the Associate Appellant were excluded under 1E of the Convention and 98 of IRPA, particularly because the Associate Appellant had voluntarily left Brazil without availing himself of his access to permanent resident status and a lack of prospective risk in Haiti. The Appellants argue that Canada\u2019s international obligations would require that the Associate Appellant not be excluded, as it would be in keeping with those obligations due to his involuntary departure from Brazil, his prospective risk in Brazil, lack of state protection or IFA there, as well as his prospective risk in Haiti. I find that it is in keeping with Canada\u2019s international obligations, particularly under the Convention, that the Associate Appellant be excluded under 1E, in light of the appropriate considerations in his particular situation as detailed hereinbelow. Conclusion regarding Associate Appellant Given that: the Associate Appellant had access to status in Brazil and failed to acquire it; his departure from Brazil and loss of status was voluntary; the Associate Appellant has not rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Brazil; there is a viable IFA in Brazil for the Associate Appellant; the Associate Appellant did not establish forward-facing harm if he were to return to Brazil; ; the Associate Appellant is not credible regarding his allegations of prospective risk in Haiti: in weighing these factors that favour the exclusion of the Associate Appellant, vs. the credible allegations that the Associate Appellant was threatened and attacked by three individuals in Brazil in February 2016 on several occasions; and that the Associate Appellant could not return to Brazil, which are factors that weigh against the exclusion of the Associate Appellant, I find that the factors for exclusion outweigh those against exclusion. I put particular importance on the lack of prospective risk in Haiti and the lack of prospective risk in Brazil, combined with the Associate Appellant\u2019s voluntary departure from Brazil and failure to verify his access to permanent resident status there. I therefore find that the RPD did not err in its finding that the Associate Appellant is excluded under sections 1E of the Convention and 98 of IRPA. DETERMINATION The appeal is allowed for the Principal Appellant Elisabeth Rouzier. The RPD decision is set aside. I find that the Principal Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution in Haiti based on her membership in a particular social group, namely women who fear gender-related persecution. I substitute my own decision that the Principal Appellant Elisabeth Rouzier is a Convention refugee in accordance with section 96 of IRPA. The appeal is dismissed for the Associate Appellant Olivier Duclair. I confirm the determination of the RPD that the Associate Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200106 Docket: IMM-5474-18 Citation: 2020 FC 14 Ottawa, Ontario, January 6, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice James W. O'Reilly BETWEEN: MANJINDER KAUR JAWANDA AND RANJIT SINGH JAWANDA Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] The applicants, Ms Manjinder Kaur Jawanda and Mr Ranjit Singh Jawanda, are citizens of India. They arrived in Canada in 2016 to visit their son, a permanent resident of Canada. Shortly after arrival, Ms Jawanda became ill with pneumonia and was admitted to hospital. She remained there for several weeks in intensive care. Once she was released, the applicants filed a request for permanent residence in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds. They maintained that Ms Jawanda would not receive proper care or support in India, especially since their only son lived in Canada. Ms Jawanda was the principal applicant on the H&C; Mr Jawanda was identified as a dependant. [2] An immigration officer reviewed the H&C application and denied it. The officer erroneously identified Mr Jawanda as the principal applicant. She found that the applicants were not well-established in Canada, having only lived here a little more than 2 years. Further, she noted that Mr Jawanda did not speak either official language. While Ms Jawanda and their son both spoke English, the officer discounted the significance of that factor since she presumed Mr Jawanda was the actual applicant. The officer also considered it a negative factor that Mr Jawanda had overstayed his visitor visa. [3] The officer also found that there was no evidence that Ms Jawanda could not be cared for in India. Further, the officer cited a physician\u2019s opinion that Ms Jawanda could safely travel home. The officer justified her conclusion, in part, on the basis that, even in Canada, medical patients sometimes receive inadequate care and are exploited or mistreated. [4] The applicants argue that the officer\u2019s decision was unreasonable because she misidentified the principal applicant and took extraneous factors into account. They ask me to quash the officer\u2019s decision and order another officer to reconsider their application. [5] I agree with the applicants. The officer wrongly identified Mr Jawanda as the principal applicant; her negative conclusion on the H&C was unreasonable as a result. II. Was the officer\u2019s decision unreasonable? [6] The Minister argues that the officer\u2019s misidentification of the principal applicant was inconsequential. The officer was entitled, says the Minister, to take account of Mr Jawanda\u2019s language skills. Further, the officer could consider Mr Jawanda\u2019s lack of status in Canada after his visitor\u2019s visa ran out. As for Ms Jawanda\u2019s medical situation, according to the Minister, the officer properly took account of that evidence. [7] I disagree with the Minister\u2019s submissions. The officer clearly based her conclusion on an incorrect factual finding about the identity of the principal applicant. The officer stated that Ms Jawanda and her son could speak English, but found that fact irrelevant given that it was not their application under consideration. Further, the officer considered two significant negative factors against Mr Jawanda \u2013 that he had not enrolled in courses to learn an official language, and that his status in Canada had expired. Neither of these factors applied to the principal applicant. Accordingly, the officer\u2019s conclusion, particularly on the issue of establishment, could well had been different if she had properly identified the principal applicant and weighed the evidence in her favour appropriately. III. Conclusion and Disposition [8] The officer wrongly identified the principal applicant, and her resulting conclusion was unreasonable. I must, therefore, allow this application for judicial review and order another officer to reconsider the applicants\u2019 H&C application. Neither party proposed a question of general importance for me to certify, and none is stated.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TC012535 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW These are my reasons for allowing the appeal by Akynyi Zawadi Otieno (Ms. A). After independently reviewing the record, I find that the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) is incorrect and that Ms. A is a Convention refugee and person in need of protection. Background Ms. A is a Kenyan widow who fears persecution by her deceased husband\u2019s brothers (\u201cthe brothers\u201d) and the Sungusungu gang. After her husband passed away in 2006 because of cancer, the brothers accused her of witchcraft and blamed her for his death. Ms. A tried for two years to convince them otherwise but eventually left when she realized they would not change their minds. Ms. A gave up ownership of the lands she inherited from her husband in 2008. She sought help from the community elders, but they refused because the brothers had informed the Sungusungu about her suspected witchcraft. When she went to the police for help, the police jailed her instead. She was detained for three days and ultimately released on payment of a bribe. Immediately after her release, Ms. A left Nakuru for Kiambu in Nairobi, where she was assisted by a church that later employed her. She lived and worked in Nairobi until December 2018, when she travelled to the United States (US) to attend a conference. While in the US, Ms. A\u2019s father passed away. She returned to Kenya in January 2019 to attend his funeral. At this time, she was approached by an agent for AMG, a company that wanted to build a housing complex on a piece of land that she and her husband had purchased together. The brothers approached her the next day and told her to sign over ownership of the land that AMG wanted so that they could benefit from the sale. They reminded her that they believed she was a witch and that the Sungusungu had her on their wanted list. Ms. A immediately returned to Kiambu to hide. In February 2019, she was approached by hitmen whom the brothers had hired. She was able to pay them off and afterward made plans to leave the country. On the advice of others, she obtained a visa for Canada and arrived here in March 2019. The RPD rejected Ms. A\u2019s claim because it found she has internal flight alternatives (IFAs) in both Mombasa and Eldoret. Arguments on appeal Ms. A contests the RPD\u2019s findings on both prongs of the IFA test. She argues that the RPD misconstrued and ignored evidence. She also argues that the RPD focused only on the risk posed by the brothers and thus failed to consider the risk she faces from the Sungusungu. Finally, Ms. A argues that the RPD failed to consider how the stigma of being accused of witchcraft and being rearrested by police might affect her ability to relocate to either IFA location. Ms. A has introduced new evidence, and she has requested an oral hearing. Role of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) I have applied the standard of correctness while reviewing the RPD\u2019s decision and have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence before me. NEW EVIDENCE According to the law, I can only accept evidence that arose after the rejection of the claims, was not reasonably available, or could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have been presented at the time of the RPD\u2019s decision. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it. In her written statement, Ms. A indicated that she was not introducing any new evidence. However, one of the articles provided as a copy of a submission made to the RPD does not appear in the RPD record. As a result, I have assessed its admissibility as new evidence. The article is not admitted The journal article that Ms. A submitted with her appeal record, which does not appear in the RPD record, is dated January 28, 2012. The article is available online. It is up to Ms. A to make full and detailed submissions about how any of the proposed new evidence meets the requirements of the law and how that evidence relates to her. In the present case, no submissions have been made to explain why this article, which was reasonably available before the RPD made its decision, was not provided at that time. I therefore find that this article does not meet the legislated criteria for admission, and I reject the application. The application for an oral hearing is dismissed The RAD may hold an oral hearing only when there is new evidence that raises a serious issue about the Appellant\u2019s credibility, is central to the decision, and which, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim. Since I am not admitting any new evidence, I am not permitted, by law, to hold a hearing. The application is therefore dismissed. ANALYSIS I find that the RPD erred by failing to adequately consider the gendered component of Ms. A\u2019s claim, particularly in relation to the reasonableness of asking her to relocate to an IFA. My reasons are as follows. Counsel for Ms. A focused the arguments on the RPD\u2019s assessment of risk from the Sungusungu, the stigma that Ms. A would face from the accusation of witchcraft, and the risk of rearrest by police because of the witchcraft accusation. These arguments miss the error that arises perceptibly from the record and the RPD\u2019s application of the Gender Guideline. The first error, though not critical to the outcome of the appeal, is nevertheless sufficiently important that I believe it needs to be addressed. This relates to land ownership and its nuance in this case. This is not a \u201cregular\u201d case of land ownership The RPD found that \u201c\u2026 although the brothers in law are using gender-based allegations of witchcraft to threaten the claimant, their purpose is to obtain her land; her forward facing risk is tied to the land, not gender based persecution.\u201d The RPD explained that land ownership is not a fundamental human right and noted that the land the brothers wanted was neither Ms. A\u2019s primary domicile nor property that she was dependent upon for her livelihood. In Sanchez, the Federal Court of Appeal held that refugee claimants must make reasonable choices that would protect their lives and avoid the risk of harm. Many other Federal Court decisions have held that property rights or lawsuits are not grounds for seeking protection. I therefore agree with the RPD that being forced to abandon land or property does not necessarily constitute a basis for a refugee claim. However, the problem is the RPD\u2019s characterization of Ms. A\u2019s forward-facing risk as being either tied to the land or to gender-based persecution. I do not see how the two can be separated. The RPD had already accepted that Ms. A was persecuted into leaving Nakuru for Nairobi. The persecution that Ms. A faced at that time was both in being called a witch but also in being called a witch for the purpose of denying her legal rights to inherit her husband\u2019s ancestral land. The decision by the brothers to later pressure her to abandon land that she had helped to purchase is rooted in gender inequality and sexism. It was an exercise of entitlement, privilege and power in a system where the rights of women generally, and widowed women especially, are given little protection. I recognize the RPD\u2019s point that the evidence produced by Ms. A indicates that men have also been accused of witchcraft by people who sought to obtain their land and property. However, in my view, the fact that men are also accused of witchcraft does not negate the gendered element of the pressure that Ms. A faced in 2019. If the RPD was able to accept that Ms. A\u2019s persecution between 2006 and 2008 was both gender-based and related to land, it should have been able to conclude the same for the threats she received in 2019. In some ways, the pressure Ms. A faced to sign over the land that she had jointly purchased with her husband was a greater violation because it built on the denial of rightly inherited property and meant further robbing Ms. A of her economic rights and the fruits of her own labour. It pushed her from a home and town where she had resources and support to a situation where, as for many other widows, the defining characteristic is poverty. This issue is not determinative in itself since it was not determinative of the RPD\u2019s decision. However, it is important to the analysis of the reasonableness of Ms. A\u2019s relocation to either Eldoret or Mombasa and contributes to the reasons why the RPD\u2019s IFA assessment is incorrect. Before explaining this, however, I must first address the RPD\u2019s assessment of the first prong of the IFA test. The RPD\u2019s IFA analysis The test to determine whether refugee claimants should be required to seek safety elsewhere in their country of origin is two pronged. The first prong asks whether there are any locations in the country of reference where a refugee claimant may live without facing a serious possibility of persecution. That assessment involves considering how motivated the agents of persecution are in finding the claimant and their capacity to reach them. If a safe location can be identified, then the RPD must consider the second prong of the test, which asks whether it would be reasonable under the circumstances to ask a person to relocate to that place. I will only briefly address the first prong because I find that the appeal turns on the second. The RPD found that the brothers are not motivated by witchcraft allegations to pursue Ms. A to other parts of the country because they had not pursued her for ten years between 2008 and 2018, and because they had not harmed her in the two years that she was living with them in Nakuru. The RPD found that the risk she faced stemmed from her ownership of land and that, if she gave up this land, she would be safe. The RPD also found that, because the property would pass to Ms. A\u2019s children rather than the brothers in the event of her death, the brothers had no incentive to kill her. Finally, the RPD found that there was insufficient evidence to show that the brothers had corrupt connections who could help them usurp the land from Ms. A\u2019s children. Ms. A has not challenged those findings. Instead, she argues that the RPD focused on the wrong agent of persecution. She argues that the RPD did not question Ms. A\u2019s fear of the Sungusungu or her evidence of being targeted by them. She further argues that the RPD neither considered that the Sungusungu have an ongoing interest in eliminating the practice of witchcraft nor that the Sungusungu have a national reach. Finally, she argues that the RPD erred in finding that the hitmen who approached her were not part of an organized national group. I agree with Ms. A that the RPD did not do a thorough analysis of the risk that she faces from the Sungusungu, but I find that this does not change the outcome of the RPD\u2019s assessment of the first prong of the IFA test. This is because I find that there is insufficient evidence to show that the Sungusungu have an ongoing interest in Ms. A. The referral of the witchcraft allegation to the Sungusungu occurred sometime before 2008. The country conditions evidence indicates that, although the Sungusungu seek to eliminate undesirables, they also investigate, gather evidence and act. The fact that Ms. A was not approached in Nakuru for the ten years between 2008 and 2018 indicates that the Sungusungu do not have a particular interest in her. This inference is strengthened, in my view, by the evidence that the Sungusungu have strong networks and police connections that would have enabled them to find her in Kiambu in that time if they had wished to do so. Ms. A\u2019s evidence is that the hitmen also offered to leave her alone if she paid them because the brothers had not paid them properly. Based on this evidence, and if I were to assume that the hitmen were Sungusungu, I conclude that the accusation of witchcraft was not sufficient motivation for them to harm Ms. A. The hitmen\u2019s willingness to leave Ms. A alone indicates that the witchcraft accusations would not, on a balance of probabilities, continue to cause problems or pursuit by the Sungusungu. For all of these reasons, I find that the RPD\u2019s assessment of the first prong of the IFA test is correct and that Ms. A would not face a serious possibility of persecution in the IFA locations. I further find, on a balance of probabilities, that Ms. A would not face a risk to her life, or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in those locations. It would be unreasonable for Ms. A to move to an IFA location The RPD stated that it considered the relocation difficulties faced by single women in their fifties but found that any difficulties Ms. A might face would not amount to undue hardship. It found that Ms. A\u2019s ability to speak three languages, her education, work experience in private business, government and the church, as well as her travel and previous independent life in Nairobi, all pointed to her capacity to relocate. Ms. A has argued that the RPD\u2019s analysis is flawed because it did not consider the stigma she would face as a woman accused of witchcraft and because the RPD did not consider the possibility that the police may still want to arrest her because of the witchcraft allegations. As I stated earlier, the RPD\u2019s failure to connect the pressure on Ms. A to renounce her right to retain property that she rightfully purchased with her husband, or to profit from its sale, is directly relevant to the reasonableness of her relocation to one of the IFAs. This is largely because of the financial position in which it places Ms. A and the situation in which single women are placed in Kenya. I begin by noting the observation by the United Nations (UN) Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women that there is a failure by state authorities to not only protect older women from violence but also to collect and publish data about the situation of older women in the country. The lack of data is a reflection of the low social standing and lack of priority given to women and older women. It also means that the RPD, and now I, must rely on reasoned inferences to determine the reasonableness of Ms. A\u2019s IFAs. It will not be sufficient, in a context where it has been acknowledged that relevant information is not being collected or published, to point to an appellant or claimant and demand that they furnish documentary evidence to establish the unreasonableness of the proposed IFAs. For the sake of simplicity, I will only discuss the conditions in the larger city, Mombasa, to demonstrate why the RPD\u2019s decision and reasoning are incorrect. General conditions in Kenya and Mombasa The documentary evidence for Kenya indicates that it is a relatively large country, with 47 counties. There are many ethnic groups in the country, and though they are not a national majority, the Kisii form one of the minority ethnic groups. Swahili is the primary language spoken throughout Kenya, and approximately 83 percent of Kenyans are Christian. Generally, where a person fears non-state actors, they can escape that risk by relocating internally. Mombasa is the second-largest city in Kenya and is located in Mombasa county, on the southeastern coast. It is a port city with a population of about 1.296 million people. Mombasa has its own international airport, and the evidence indicates that the telecommunications network is well-developed, affordable, and reliable, and wi-fi service is available. The documentary evidence indicates that Kenyans are able to move freely throughout the country and reside anywhere. Employment opportunities are available in Mombasa, although women continue to face discrimination. Despite laws prohibiting discrimination, women continue to experience discrimination and inequality in employment. Women dominate the informal sector, comprising only 30 percent of the private sector, and they face barriers to formal employment and other paid activities. These barriers include the traditional position of women in society, occupational segregation by gender and limited access to financial resources and technology. Unemployment and underemployment are generally high in Kenya, estimated at about 40 percent of the population. Kenya does not provide unemployment benefits. Housing appears to be available. Poverty affects many Kenyans but is more pronounced in rural areas. A lack of, or inadequate, housing is one way in which poverty is experienced. The National Documentation Package (NDP) reports that Kenya has a housing deficit of 2 million housing units. However, the Kenyan government has introduced a policy that makes affordable housing one of its pillars to drive economic growth, with an aim to deliver 500,000 housing units by 2022. Approximately 83 percent of the housing supply is for high-income individuals and families, but the 2019/2020 government budget allocation toward housing was raised by 61.5 percent over the previous year, evidencing an active commitment toward addressing the housing shortage. I have no other evidence before me to indicate that the government\u2019s efforts have not translated into greater availability of affordable housing. Public healthcare is available though not always adequate or accessible. The best public healthcare facilities are located in Nairobi, and the most underdeveloped area with respect to healthcare is the north-eastern province. Mombasa, however, is in the south-east, and there is no evidence before me to suggest that it falls into the same category of underdevelopment as the north-eastern area of the country. The Kenyan government launched a universal healthcare program in December 2018. Under this program, user fees were removed, and access to medicines, operations, consultations, laboratory tests and radiation therapy faced long waiting times. Unfortunately, there have been long waiting times for these services, and the supply of medicines and lab services has dwindled, pushing patients back toward private health care. Strikes by health workers have also affected access to care. Generally, Kenyan healthcare facilities are considered understaffed, ill-equipped, plagued by issues of low-quality medication, unreliable emergency services, and widespread corruption. In terms of mental healthcare, the evidence indicates that there is a considerable shortage of psychiatrists and mental health services. Most of these services are located in urban areas and require the payment of high consultation fees. Application of the country conditions to Ms. A\u2019s evidence An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option. I have therefore considered how a woman in Ms. A\u2019s circumstances would navigate the housing, employment and healthcare conditions in Mombasa to determine whether they will make relocation unduly difficult or may endanger her life and security. Ms. A is a 54-year-old Christian Kisii woman. She speaks Swahili, Kisii, and English. She has worked for Airtel-Telkom, then alongside her husband in his business, and later as a bookkeeper for a church. She has travelled alone and done some administrative work during the roughly four months that she spent in the US. She returned to Kenya and, because the church that had previously employed her could no longer do so, she volunteered with them in exchange for accommodation. Ms. A is currently single and has three adult children, all of whom live in Kenya, in Maralal. She has six living siblings, who are also located in Maralal. She has lost her right to inherit her husband\u2019s ancestral property and has been chased from her birth or family home in Nyanza. She has effectively had to renounce her right to the only other plot of land she legally owns or could profit from to finance her accommodation or livelihood elsewhere. The factors that favour Ms. A\u2019s ability to relocate are her ability to speak Swahili, the primary language in Kenya, and the fact that she is Christian, like the vast majority of Kenyans. This has historically helped her to escape violence and to rebuild her life by gaining the help and support of a church. This has offset the fact that Ms. A has no family or support network in Nairobi. Her ability to gain employment at the church is also due to her education, skills, and work history. These factors suggest that Ms. A would be able to rebuild her life in Mombasa by applying the same strategy or by relying on the support of churches to settle herself. However, I note that to some degree, Ms. A\u2019s experience in resorting to that strategy has proved unreliable. On her second attempt to flee the brothers, this time in 2019, the church was no longer able to employ her, and Ms. A was put in the position of volunteering her time in order to secure accommodation. I find that this lived experience diminishes the weight that can be placed on Ms. A\u2019s capacity to rely on churches to help her get resettled. Additionally, Ms. A is 54 years old and has no family or support network in Mombasa. Without this, the church is really her only option for support, and with the evidence indicating that significant numbers of women flee gender-based violence in Kenya, it seems unreasonable to expect that Kenyan churches will be able to provide assistance to each of these women. The evidence indicates that single women are pushed into living in informal settlements or slums where they face physical and sexual violence, all of which is sure to result in psychological trauma as well. The evidence is therefore that, for women without family or other support networks, fleeing domestic violence often only throws them at the mercy of other abusers who are able to act with impunity. It is not surprising then that the NDP states that single women with no support network or accompanying family members may find it unreasonable to relocate. If employment can be considered a way out of the informal settlements and into some form of physical security, that too seems elusive. In Nairobi, women with low levels of education can find informal or menial work on an erratic basis. The same can be assumed of Mombasa. Employment is also easier to obtain when one has a network of contacts and connections. Ms. A\u2019s past employment does not offer a sufficient basis on which to infer that she would be able to establish herself economically. The evidence before me is that Ms. A lost her government job many years ago and was never again formally employed by the government. She later joined her husband in a small business enterprise. Although this indicates that she likely has the skills to operate a business, it does not mean that she has the means to start one or that she would be formally hired by another business. Her employment at the church was arranged through a connection. Similarly, Ms. A\u2019s travel and experience abroad were only made possible because of her years of work at the church in Kiambu. Moreover, it can also be presumed that, if Ms. A were to attempt to start her own business, she would need funds or credit to establish the store and stock wares. However, the NDP notes that women lack access to economic resources and are often unable to access credit because land is the primary form of collateral when seeking credit. Ms. A\u2019s loss of property or the right to dispose of her property and benefit from the sale, therefore, directly affects her capacity to relocate. Demanding relocation in this context, therefore, seems to enforce the persecutory conditions and process initiated by the brothers. The gaps in assistance from Ms. A\u2019s family are also unfilled by social programs. The country evidence indicates that social security programs have faced implementation and coordination challenges, resulting in delay and inconsistent disbursement of funds to vulnerable children, older persons, and people with severe disabilities. I therefore find that, in the absence of any accompanying family members or an existing support network, Ms. A will face considerable hurdles that endanger her security as a single, older woman relocating to Mombasa. The RPD failed to consider these gendered nuances of Ms. A\u2019s situation or how her lived experience already tested her capacity to rely solely on her religious community for support. Although she may be able to volunteer her time to secure accommodation in an IFA location, I find the precarity of that kind of existence does not meet the requirement that an IFA be sustainable. For these reasons, I find that the RPD erred. I therefore find, on a balance of probabilities, that in the particular circumstances of Ms. A\u2019s case, there are no viable IFAs. Accordingly, I find that Ms. A faces a serious possibility of persecution, as well as a risk to her life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Kenya. CONCLUSION The appeal is allowed. I set aside the determination of the RPD and substitute my own decision that Ms. A is a Convention refugee and a person in need of protection.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Akynyi Zawadi Otieno', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 34, 'end': 37}, {'text': 'Nakuru', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 229, 'end': 230}, {'text': 'Kiambu', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 231, 'end': 232}, {'text': 'December', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 254, 'end': 255}, {'text': 'January', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 289, 'end': 290}, {'text': 'AMG', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 307, 'end': 308}, {'text': 'build a housing complex', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 314, 'end': 318}, {'text': 'AMG', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 350, 'end': 351}, {'text': 'Kiambu', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 387, 'end': 388}, {'text': 'February', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 392, 'end': 393}, {'text': 'March', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 438, 'end': 439}, {'text': 'Nakuru', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1315, 'end': 1316}, {'text': 'Nakuru', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1873, 'end': 1874}, {'text': 'Nakuru', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 2190, 'end': 2191}, {'text': 'Kiambu', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 2242, 'end': 2243}, {'text': 'Airtel-Telkom', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3577, 'end': 3580}, {'text': 'bookkeeper', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3593, 'end': 3594}, {'text': 'administrative', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3605, 'end': 3606}, {'text': 'Maralal', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3667, 'end': 3668}, {'text': 'Maralal', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3680, 'end': 3681}, {'text': 'Nyanza', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3705, 'end': 3706}, {'text': 'Kiambu', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 4329, 'end': 4330}, {'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 4711, 'end': 4712}, {'text': 'Zawadi Otieno', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 35, 'end': 37}, {'text': 'Kiambu', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 231, 'end': 232}, {'text': 'December', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 254, 'end': 255}, {'text': 'January', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 289, 'end': 290}, {'text': 'Kiambu', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 387, 'end': 388}, {'text': 'February', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 392, 'end': 393}, {'text': 'March', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 438, 'end': 439}, {'text': 'Kiambu', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 2242, 'end': 2243}, {'text': 'Kiambu', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 4329, 'end': 4330}, {'text': 'Akynyi', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 34, 'end': 35}, {'text': 'Nakuru', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 229, 'end': 230}, {'text': 'AMG', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 307, 'end': 308}, {'text': 'build a housing complex', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 314, 'end': 318}, {'text': 'AMG', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 350, 'end': 351}, {'text': 'Nakuru', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 1315, 'end': 1316}, {'text': 'Nakuru', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 1873, 'end': 1874}, {'text': 'Nakuru', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 2190, 'end': 2191}, {'text': 'Airtel-Telkom', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3577, 'end': 3580}, {'text': 'bookkeeper', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3593, 'end': 3594}, {'text': 'administrative', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3605, 'end': 3606}, {'text': 'Maralal', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3667, 'end': 3668}, {'text': 'Maralal', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3680, 'end': 3681}, {'text': 'Nyanza', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3705, 'end': 3706}]", "label": "Accepted"}
{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TC0-09304 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW John Joseph Kollie (Appellant) is of Liberian nationality. He is submitting this appeal before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) against a decision issued by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), that rejected his claim for refugee protection on June 22, 2020. The Appellant alleges that he fears members of his family over the ownership of lands located in the Bong county, that belonged to his parents but that he administered after their death, to the disagreement of his uncles and cousins (agents of harm). The Appellant posits that he was attacked by the agents of harm on July 5, 2016 as he was trying to survey the land to have it registered under his name. He was hospitalised as a result. The Appellant left Liberia for the USA on August 24, 2017 and was married with a cousin and friend on October 1, 2017. His spouse filed an application to sponsor the Appellant so that he would become an American permanent resident, but the marriage fell apart and the application was withdrawn on September 13, 2019, prompting the rejection of his application on October 10, 2019. The Appellant entered Canada on October 20, 2019 and asked for refugee protection upon his entry. The determinative issues before the RPD were credibility and Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). Before the RAD, the determinative issues include credibility and prospective risk. I consider it unnecessary to address the issue of the IFA. The claim was assessed under section 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), as since it is based on a land dispute, there is no nexus to the Convention. DECISION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. ROLE OF THE RAD The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is that the RAD may apply a deferential standard in some circumstances. I have conducted my own independent assessment of all of the evidence in this case, including the audio-recording of the hearing. Unless specifically stated and explained below, I have applied a correctness standard in this case. ANALYSIS In the context of this appeal, I will accept as established the alleged fact that the Appellant inherited the disputed land in Bong county at the death of his father in 2016 and that he was attacked by his family members on July 15, 2016, as alleged. I will therefore not address the Appellant\u2019s appeal submissions regarding the credibility issues raised by the RPD in regards to those events. Indeed, I find that the RPD erred in not considering the objective evidence that corroborates the Appellant\u2019s claim. The National Documentation Package for Liberia (NDP) clearly indicates that land disputes are a live issue in Liberia that threatens its national security. The problem of land disputes is further analysed in the document from the Berghof Foundation entitled Pragmatism and mistrust: The Interaction of dispute resolution mechanisms in Liberia. This document explains: \u201cConflicts can arise, for instance, when tenants have been living at a property for many years but do not have a deed and someone purchases the land without their knowledge, or when families have disputes over inheritance.\u201d Most relevant to this case, the same document states that \u201cmore central to the conflict was arguably the role that the youth played in terms of their perceived discrimination and lack of access to land within the customary system\u201d. I understand from the Appellant\u2019s narrative in his Basis of Claim (BOC), that his uncles believe him to be too young to administer the land and they see themselves as rightful owners in part because of their status as elders. The Appellant is expected to give up his land to ensure his security The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in formulating his claim as one revolving around the issue of livelihood regarding the ownership of the disputed land. Rather, the record indicates that the Appellant fears being harmed or subjected to cruel and unusual punishment by his family members because he is the only man heir carrying the family name. He argues that the RPD erroneously applied Sanchez as the facts of this instant case are distinguishable. He insists that even after ceding the land to his uncle, he would still be targeted because seen as a threat. At the hearing, when questioned by the member about the expected consequences of giving up the land to the agents of harm, the Appellant clearly stated his position that the land was his \u201cinheritance\u201d, his \u201cfamily property\u201d and that his family livelihood depended on it. He then added that he was the one carrying the family name and that the agents of harm see him as a threat to their property to which he has a right. Answering his counsel\u2019s similar question, the Appellant reiterated that he was the only male survivor carrying the family name and that the agents of harm would see him as a threat as long as he is alive because he could protest against them to recuperate what they took from him. He argues that they would get rid of him just like they did to his father and use unknown intermediaries to attack him and kill him. I believe that the RPD correctly applied the rational of the Sanchez judgement to this case. Contrary to the Appellant\u2019s arguments, I find that the case revolves around a land dispute. The Appellant opines that this land is his birth right, and therefore should not be given away to the agents of harm who are currently selling parts of it away. As well analysed by the RPD and not contested on appeal, the Appellant\u2019s livelihood does not depend on this land, as he has other business ventures and would be able to find gainful employment in Liberia. The right to own property does not constitute an internationally recognised human right. In application to the reasoning in the Sanchez case, the Appellant is expected to make choices that will free him of the risk of harm, which in this case translates to formally ceding the rights to administer the land to the benefit of the agents of harm and thereby preventing that they will try to \u201cget him out of the way.\u201d I note, in particular, the Appellant\u2019s sister Mary\u2019s affidavit, in which she reports the threat uttered by their cousin Emmanuel, the email read: \u201cyou see what we did to your brother, tell him to turn over the documents or else, he won\u2019t survive the next one, we are coming for him.\u201d This demonstrates that a formal and legal transfer of the right of administration of the land to the agents of harm will likely remove the potential threat that the Appellant could incur upon his return to Liberia. I understand that this scenario would be difficult for the Appellant as he perceives the administration of the land as his birth right. However, the rules applicable to the sections 96 and 97 of IRPA are clear: the right of property inheritance does not constitute a protected human right and that the Appellant is expected to make the difficult choice to let go of the land to the benefit of his security and the one of his family. The Appellant argues that he fears violent repercussions upon his return, because he will still be a threat for the agent of harm. However, as per his testimony, his opinion is based on: (i) his right to the land and the possibility that his uncles could still see him as a threat who could attack them to recuperate his land; and (ii) his suspicions that his father was in fact attacked and killed by the agents of harm in 2016. In my view, his suspicions regarding the cause of death of his father remain speculative, as the link between the unknown attackers and the family member has not been established, on a balance of probabilities. In any event, it cannot serve as a valid precedent in the instant case, as he is expected to formally transfer the right of administration of the land to the agents of harms to ensure his own security, an act that his father did not seemingly undertake. I am sensitive to the Appellant\u2019s difficult situation. However, as pointed out by the RPD, and elaborated in the NDP, he can also resort to the efficient dispute mechanism in place that deals with such disputes that was not previously used by the Appellant: According to one paramount chief, the customary method of solving a land dispute doesn\u2019t differ dramatically from the resolution of other types of conflict, although the features he described resembled arbitration much more than mediation: listening to the two parties, having a type of \u201chearing\u201d with questions and answers, visiting the site of the land dispute, doing an investigation, visiting the town chief and the elders in the area in order to get an explanation, deciding \u201cwho is right and who is wrong\u201d, and then ultimately passing a ruling (Interview: 11.9.15). I understand that the Liberian land property system seems riddled with uncertainty, but I note that the Appellant is aware of the legal processes in place to administer the land, as he explained in his BOC that he assisted his father in surveying the land and selling parts of it. He is therefore in a position to proceed with the valid and legal transfer of the title, as it was aggressively demanded by his cousin. In this perspective, and after having considered the totality of the evidence adduced by the Appellant, including the affidavits of his friends and sister, I consider that he failed to establish that after transferring the land to the agents of harm in a clear and formal manner, he would still be at risk of harm or subjected to cruel and unusual punishment by his family members. Alternatively, it would be expected of him to use the traditional dispute resolution mechanism in place to solve the problem, if he so desires. Consequently, I conclude that the RPD was correct when it ruled that the Appellant had not established that he faced a serious possibility of persecution pursuant to section 96 of IRPA or that he qualified as a person in need of protection as per subsection 97(1) of IRPA. CONCLUSION I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

{"doc_text": " RAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAR : MC008158 MC008159 / MC008160 / MC008161 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision \u2013 Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Mateo Lopez Flores Garcia (the male appellant), Maria Jose Lopez Perez (the female appellant), and their daughters, Elena Luna Flores Lopez and Ana Carolina Flores Lopez (the minor appellants), are citizens of Mexico. They are appealing the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated March 16, 2020, rejecting their claims for refugee protection on the grounds that the male appellant\u2019s testimony was not credible with respect to his allegations that they were targeted by the Jalisco Nueva Generacion cartel (CJNG) from 2010 to 2018 when they were living in the city of Aguascalientes. The Minister intervened before the RPD to request the exclusion of the male appellant under Article 1F(b) of the Convention and section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Minister did not intervene before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). The RPD found that the male appellant\u2019s allegations concerning his participation in the cartel\u2019s criminal activities were not credible, and that there was therefore no basis for the exclusion. Given the lack of credibility, the RPD rejected the claims, which were all based on the male appellant\u2019s written account. First, the appellants submit that the RPD erred in its legal reasoning by not recognizing that the male appellant had participated in the cartel\u2019s activities but had done so under duress, and should therefore not be excluded under Article 1F(b) of the Convention. Second, they argue that the RPD had made a decision before it heard them and that it did not consider their profile. They also contest the credibility findings, stating that their testimony was reliable and that they should benefit from the presumption set out in Maldonado. After reviewing the entire record, the RAD concludes, first, that there was no breach of procedural fairness. The member did not prejudge the claim before hearing the appellants. Next, for the reasons that follow, the RAD is of the opinion that the RPD\u2019s decision is incorrect because Article 1F(b) of the Convention and section 98 of the IRPA should apply in the male appellant\u2019s case. He is excluded from Canada\u2019s protection because he committed a serious nonpolitical crime and did not establish a defence of duress. Finally, following the panel\u2019s review of the record as a whole, the female appellants\u2019 appeals are dismissed because they have not established, on a balance of probabilities, that they would be personally subjected to a risk or threat from CJNG members if they returned to Mexico, or that they would have a wellfounded fear of persecution on any grounds. BACKGROUND The written account appended to the appellant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), on which the four appeals are based, states that he was in contact with, then threatened and attacked by, CJNG members and was then forced to work for them, from 2010 to 2018. The male appellant worked as a security guard in a manufacturing plant in the city of Aguascalientes from 2008 to 2016. He stated that he met his alleged attackers for the first time at his workplace in May 2010. Believing that they were simply potential customers, the male appellant allegedly gave them his business card. He stated that, between 2010 and November 2014, he and his alleged attackers met at least 20 or so times. His attackers, who were not aggressive at the time, allegedly started by asking the male appellant to work for them and their future travel agency, then asked him to take suitcases from one location to another without saying what was inside, then asked him to give them the money that was paid so they could expand their business. The male appellant states that he was paid for each service rendered. In the meantime, in October 2013, his alleged attackers allegedly asked him to work as a guard for them, which he agreed to do. In January and February 2014, the male appellant allegedly learned from the television news that the people he was working for were in fact members of the CJNG. Fearing for his life, the male appellant allegedly went into hiding but was found and confronted in March 2014, then beaten up, threatened with death and stabbed in May 2014 for avoiding his alleged attackers. He was allegedly treated by the Red Cross. While he was staying at the Red Cross, his alleged attackers, accompanied by police officers, kidnapped him and held him captive in a warehouse overnight. They allegedly brought him home the next day and told him to keep quiet or he and his family would die. The male appellant stated that he worked for the cartel members on a regular basis from November 2014 to December 2018, at which time his alleged attackers found him and his family again after they had moved. During this time, the male appellant allegedly collaborated in the cartel\u2019s various criminal activities, in particular transporting drugs throughout Mexico. The appellants left Mexico to come to Canada, where they made a claim for refugee protection on September 29, 2019. SCOPE OF THE APPEAL In accordance with the principles of Huruglica, the RAD carried out an independent review of the evidence submitted in support of the appeal, including the transcript of the hearing in this case. Given that the RPD did not enjoy a meaningful advantage with respect to assessing credibility, the RAD applied the correctness standard. ANALYSIS The Refugee Protection Division did not breach procedural fairness In their memoranda, the appellants submit that the RPD prejudged their case before having heard them, because of this statement in paragraph 19 of its decision: [translation] \u201cthe story in his BOC Form proved to be inconsistent, as it was full of omissions and implausibilities.\u201d In presenting their argument this way in the memorandum prepared by their counsel, the appellants are misleading the panel. The full passage in paragraph 19 reads as follows: [translation] \u201cThe claimant\u2019s testimony was difficult because, on several occasions, the story in his BOC Form proved to be inconsistent, as it was full of omissions and implausibilities.\u201d Thus, the RPD was providing context for the inconsistencies, omissions and implausibilities in the male appellant\u2019s oral testimony and written account. There is nothing in the RPD\u2019s statement to support a conclusion that it had made its decision in advance, before even hearing the appellants. Accordingly, the RAD is of the opinion that an informed person viewing the matter realistically and practically, and having thought the matter through, would draw this conclusion, that is, that nothing in the file, including paragraph 19, gives the impression that the RPD showed the slightest appearance of bias. This ground of appeal is rejected. The male appellant is excluded from Canada\u2019s protection under Article 1F(b) of the Convention and section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act Section 98 of the IRPA stipulates that a person referred to in Article 1E or Article 1F of the Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. Article 1F reads as follows: F. The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that: b. he has committed a serious nonpolitical crime outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee; Before the RPD, the Minister argued that the male appellant\u2019s written account indicates that he committed three nonpolitical crimes that are equivalent in Canadian law to: Knowingly, by act or omission, participating or contributing to any activity of a criminal organization or enhancing the ability of a criminal organization to commit crimesAt the beginning of the hearing, the Minister\u2019s counsel informed the RPD member that the male appellant had admitted to committing the above crimes but argued that he had done so under duress. The member rightly did not pursue these admissions as she was required to make a finding as to the credibility of the appellant\u2019s allegations as a whole, as well as the Minister\u2019s claims. In light of the male appellant\u2019s testimony and all of the evidence presented, the RPD did not believe his allegations concerning his participation in the cartel\u2019s criminal activities. It stated that since his testimony was not credible, he had failed to establish that he had committed any serious nonpolitical crime. As a result, the RPD did not exclude the male appellant and rejected the claims on the grounds of his lack of credibility. In his memorandum, the male appellant contests the RPD\u2019s legal reasoning. The appellant maintains that he participated in the cartel\u2019s activities, which the RPD should have recognized as the commission of a nonpolitical crime. However, as he allegedly did so under duress, the RPD should have concluded not only that he was not excluded under Article 1F(b) and section 98 of the IRPA, but also that he and the female appellants were in need of Canada\u2019s protection because they would be personally subjected to death threats if they returned to their country. With all due respect to the RPD, the RAD is of the opinion that it erred regarding the burden of proof, the standard of proof and the application of the exclusion clause in Article 1F(b) of the Convention and section 98 of the IRPA. For the reasons that follow, the male appellant is excluded from Canada\u2019s protection. The burden of proof, standard of proof and framework of analysis with respect to Article 1F(b) of the Convention A person described in Article 1F(b) of the Convention cannot be a refugee or a protected person if there are serious reasons for considering that they have committed a nonpolitical crime outside of Canada. The standard of proof\u2014whether there are serious reasons for considering\u2014requires something more than mere suspicion, but less than a balance of probabilities. It is a standard similar to that of a serious possibility, which is set out in section 96 of the IRPA. It is now well established that the onus is on the Minister to establish that a claimant should be excluded. Therefore, the Minister bears the burden of proof regarding exclusion. However, the RPD has the jurisdiction to exclude a claimant even if the Minister has chosen not to intervene in a given case. The framework of analysis for Article 1F(b) of the Convention has been established by the case law. The first step is to determine what offence was committed by the claimant and the circumstances surrounding the offence. The next steps are to classify the crime as being either political or nonpolitical, and then to determine the equivalent offence if it were being prosecuted under Canadian law. Lastly, the seriousness of the offence must be established based on the factors set out in Jayasekara. The male appellant committed a serious nonpolitical crime With all due respect to the RPD, the male appellant was correct that it should have conducted its exclusion analysis in accordance with the established case law framework. The RAD adds that the burden of proof was with the Minister, and that the standard of proof should have been that of serious reasons for considering that a serious crime had been committed. The paragraphs introducing the RPD\u2019s analysis of the appellant\u2019s credibility make no mention of either this burden or this standard. On the contrary, with all due respect to the RPD, these passages read more like a credibility analysis under section 97 of the IRPA, with the burden of proof resting on the appellant and the standard of proof being that of the balance of probabilities. However, the RAD is of the opinion that, based on the standard of serious reasons for considering that a serious nonpolitical crime was committed, it can be concluded that the male appellant did indeed commit such a crime. The RAD has reviewed the male appellant\u2019s testimony and agrees with the RPD\u2019s statement that it was generally laboured. Several times, the male appellant evaded the member\u2019s questions. The member was patient with him, rephrasing her questions and sometimes even informing him of the credibility issues associated with his vague responses. However, one constant appears in the BOC Form, in the male appellant\u2019s testimony at the hearing and in his interview with an immigration officer prior to the RPD hearing: the male appellant states and maintains that he collaborated with CJNG members on numerous occasions over a period of about 8 years to carry out various tasks for the benefit of the cartel. In the RAD\u2019s opinion, the evidence shows that there are serious reasons for considering that the male appellant committed a number of nonpolitical offences that, in Canadian law, would correspond, at a minimum, to participating in the activities of a criminal organization (section 467.11 of the Criminal Code), as well as committing an offence for such an organization (section 467.12 of the Criminal Code). The male appellant occasionally worked as a trafficker to collect the proceeds of crime, including transporting illegal drugs. He also witnessed criminal acts involving planned attacks against other cartel members. Ultimately, the male appellant participated in the cartel\u2019s activities and committed crimes for the CJNG. Next, it must be determined whether these are serious offences. As a reminder, the case law has established that a nonpolitical crime can be recognized as serious if the maximum prison sentence under Canadian law is at least ten years. However, this factor alone is not sufficient. The elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and circumstances surrounding the commission of the crime (for example, duress), as well as any aggravating circumstances (for example, the harm caused to the victim or society, the use of a weapon, whether the crime was committed by an organized criminal group) are all factors to be considered when establishing the seriousness of the offence. The mode of prosecution for participation in the activities of a criminal organization is either summary conviction or indictment, where indictment is the only mode of prosecution for the commission of offences for the benefit of a criminal organization. This weighs in favour of recognizing the seriousness of the latter crime. The maximum prison sentence for participating in the activities of a criminal organization is five years, compared to 14 years for committing an offence for such an organization. This also weighs in favour of concluding that the second crime is serious. The facts surrounding the crimes allegedly committed by the male appellant are quite simple: he allegedly transported suitcases belonging to cartel members in order to make money, for his family. He also allegedly witnessed CJNG members harm other cartel members. At no time did he state that he himself knowingly transported illegal money and drugs throughout Mexico. He has no knowledge of the quantities or the amounts of money involved. He allegedly did not participate in the drug trafficking that he witnessed. This factor is neutral with regard to determining the seriousness of the crimes committed. In light of the foregoing, two aggravating circumstances that would give rise to a conviction are present: the impact of these crimes on society and his participation in the activities of a large cartel that is a powerful and wellorganized criminal organization in Mexico. This factor weighs in favour of recognizing the seriousness of the crime. Lastly, although the male appellant stated that he committed these crimes, he also maintains that he did so under duress, which he argues would justify not applying Article 1F(b) of the Convention and section 98 of the IRPA. For the reasons that follow, the RAD does not agree, because the appellant\u2019s testimony concerning this defence of duress was not credible. The Supreme Court of Canada described the test for the defence of duress in R. v. Ryan. The Court summarized it as follows: [81] The defence of duress, in its statutory and common law forms, is largely the same. The two forms share the following common elements: There must be an explicit or implicit threat of present or future death or bodily harm. This threat can be directed at the accused or a third party. The accused must reasonably believe that the threat will be carried out. There is no safe avenue of escape. This element is evaluated on a modified objective standard. A close temporal connection between the threat and the harm threatened. Proportionality between the harm threatened and the harm inflicted by the accused. The harm caused by the accused must be equal to or no greater than the harm threatened. This is also evaluated on a modified objective standard. The accused is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby the accused is subject to compulsion and actually knew that threats and coercion to commit an offence were a possible result of this criminal activity, conspiracy or association. The male appellant stated that on numerous occasions, they threatened to kill him or to kill his wife and daughters, who are also appellants in this case. He stated that he believed that these threats would be carried out, since he had witnessed the disappearances of other people who wanted to stop collaborating with the cartel. He testified that he did not know how to get out of the situation safely, even though four years went by between when he learned about the men\u2019s ties to the cartel and when he left the country. As the Supreme Court notes in Ryan, \u201cin order to fulfill this first requirement of the common law defence of duress, there must have been an explicit or implicit, present or future threat of death or bodily harm, directed at the accused or a third person.\u201d The RAD cannot accept the appellant\u2019s arguments in this regard because his testimony concerning his allegations of death threats made against him was not credible. The event of May 2014 The male appellant testified that he started fearing for his life in January 2014 when he found out about his alleged attackers\u2019 ties to the cartel. They allegedly threatened and physically assaulted him in May 2014 in retaliation because he had gotten away from them. He stated that his attackers had found him on the road as he was on his way to work, and that he was later treated by the Red Cross. At the hearing, the male appellant was asked about the extent of his injuries. He testified that he had been stabbed in the chest, stomach and arm, and also badly beaten. He stated that he had stayed at the Red Cross clinic for only three or four hours because he did not want to provide his personal information. However, he allegedly needed stitches in order to close his wounds. When asked about his injuries later, the appellant testified that he had been injured in the head and then the body, but that his upper arms were not affected. These two versions are not consistent with each other, and neither are they consistent with the account he gave the immigration officer. When the immigration officer asked him about his injuries from the alleged attack in May 2014, the appellant stated that he had been stabbed with a pocket knife in the back, legs and near his stomach, and pointed to some scars on his back. The appellant was not confronted specifically about the inconsistencies between these three versions of his injuries. He was asked, however, about the absence of any document corroborating his claims and what steps he had taken to obtain such a document. He testified that he had not thought to ask for the form that the attending physician allegedly filled out. He then stated that this form had been given to the police officers who came to get him. Next, he testified that he did not take any steps to obtain a copy of this document from the Red Cross because he was unaware that he could do and because he did not want to involve a third party. When questioned further about why he did not want to involve anyone else, the appellant answered that he did not know why he had said that. He then testified that he had been given a tetanus vaccine and some medication, but that no X\u2011rays or other tests had been done that would have enabled those treating him to determine the extent of his internal injuries. Still on the subject of this incident in May 2014, the appellant initially testified that he had left the clinic on his own after three or four hours of being treated. He then stated that police officers had brought him home, but then changed his answer and stated that the officers had handed him over to the cartel members, who were waiting not far from the clinic and who then brought him home at around 1:00 a.m. after holding him captive for a few hours and threatening to kill him. He later testified that he had remained at the clinic for about five hours and had left the clinic at around 1:00 or 2:00 a.m. The appellant was not confronted about the inconsistency in the sequence of events when he left the Red Cross clinic, or about the inconsistency in the two versions of how he returned home\u2014namely, that police officers who were waiting for him handed him over to the cartel members who released him at around 1:00 a.m. or that he left the clinic on his own at around 1:00 a.m. and returned home. With respect to this incident, the RPD noted only that he had not provided any document the Red Cross might have given him that would have corroborated the incident. The RPD criticized the appellant for not providing such a document or even making an effort to obtain one, though he had filed no fewer than 22 documentary exhibits in support of his claim, including a certificate of employment. The appellant contests this conclusion, stating that it is entirely logical that he could not present a medical certificate because he had been kidnapped and held captive by the cartel members when he left the clinic. The RAD sees, in this argument, a third version of the appellant\u2019s story, since he has not previously stated that he was kidnapped and held captive by the cartel members right after leaving the clinic. He initially testified that he had left the clinic alone, then that he had left accompanied by police officers, who then handed him over to the cartel members. All of these unjustified inconsistencies lead the RAD to draw a negative inference that undermines the appellant\u2019s credibility to such an extent that, although the RAD believes the appellant was injured that day in May and treated at the Red Cross clinic, it does not believe he was injured by cartel members, or that he was met by police officers who handed him over to cartel members, who then held him captive overnight. This conclusion does not support the appellant\u2019s assertion that his life had been threatened and that he had therefore been acting under duress. The alleged death threats at gunpoint The male appellant maintained and repeated several times that he had been unaware of his alleged attackers\u2019 criminal activities before January 2014 and that he had not been threatened by them until he found this out. He confirmed that he had voluntarily agreed to work as a trafficker. During his interview with the immigration officer, he stated clearly that he had agreed to work for the cartel members in October 2013 because they had pointed a gun at this head. When confronted with these two different versions, namely, that he had worked as a trafficker voluntarily and that he had been forced to do so at gunpoint, the appellant testified that he had not been threatened at that time, but later. The RPD was correct not to accept this explanation. The appellant did not explain why he had told the immigration officer that he had been threatened in October 2013 when he stated the opposite at the hearing. The RPD\u2019s decision is correct, and the appellant\u2019s credibility is seriously undermined because this is one of the only concrete situations that he described in which his life was clearly in danger. Furthermore, this version of events, which was given to the immigration officer under oath, is not consistent with the appellant\u2019s written account in his BOC Form, in which he states that [translation] \u201ceverything seemed normal [to him]\u201d up until May 2014, whereas he was regularly guarding suitcases and using the money he was paid for personal expenses. Added to this is the fact that at no point in his long and detailed written account does the appellant state that he was threatened by anyone holding a gun to his head. In his memorandum, the male appellant submits that there is no contradiction or omission in his written account with respect to the threats at gunpoint, since this is a clarification he made during in his testimony. The RAD disagrees, particularly given that the appellant argues that he was forced to work for the cartel members. This point is neither peripheral nor parenthetical nor a clarification; rather, the death threats and how they were made are central to the appellant\u2019s refugee protection claim, in addition to being the very basis of his defence of duress. He claims that he was threatened and yet responds with a contradiction regarding the use of a gun pointed at his head that he cannot satisfactorily explain. The RAD is of the opinion that the RPD\u2019s conclusion is correct. The appellant\u2019s credibility is greatly undermined to the extent that the RAD does not believe that CJNG members threatened him with a gun to his head. The absence of death threats from April 2015 to June 2018 According to the male appellant\u2019s written account, he worked knowingly for the cartel members starting in January 2014. He testified that he was constantly under threat of death following the alleged assault in May 2014. The modus operandi of his alleged attackers was apparently to ask him to carry out a task and threaten to kill him and members of his family if he refused. Yet, his written account does not mention any threats made between April 2015 and June 2018, when the cartel members allegedly threatened to kidnap his daughters and sell their organs. Yet, he described in detail the times when he allegedly worked for cartel members. When confronted about the absence of any mention of threats, the male appellant stated that he may have neglected to indicate the threats but that he had not been in hiding during this period for no reason. When again asked to explain the omissions, the appellant stated that he had been in shock and had blanked. He stated that he did not know why he had not mentioned the threats. These explanations do not justify the absence of any mention of death threats during a period of three and a half years, given that the basis of the four refugee protection claims in this case is the constant nature of these threats. The appellant\u2019s credibility is decisively undermined. Ultimately, the male appellant does not meet the first requirement of the defence of duress. As the Supreme Court has held, there must be an explicit or implicit, present or future threat of death or bodily harm directed at the claimant or at a third person. The appellant in this case does not meet this test. Conclusion on the defence of duress At this stage of the analysis, the appellant\u2019s credibility is undermined such that, while the RAD believes that he worked for the CJNG, it does not believe that at any time between 2014 and 2018 he was forced to carry out its activities because of death threats made against him or members of his family. The male appellant has established that he participated in the cartel\u2019s activities and committed multiple offences for its members from 2014 to 2018, knowingly and voluntarily. However, he has not establish that he was acting under duress, a defence that is a mitigating circumstance in the assessment of the seriousness of a serious nonpolitical crime, since the first test in Ryan was not met, that is, that there was no explicit or implicit, present or future threat of death or bodily harm. Alternatively, the RAD is of the opinion that even if the cartel members had threatened to kill him, the male appellant would still not be able to rely on a defence of duress. In Ryan, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the defence of duress is only available to a person, in this case a refugee protection claimant or an appellant, when they have committed an offence under threat of serious harm or death. The Court described the involuntary nature of this duress in these terms: [23] The rationale underlying duress is that of moral involuntariness, which was entrenched as a principle of fundamental justice in R. v. Ruzic, 2001 SCC 24\u2026 As was discussed in Perka, defences built on the principle of moral involuntariness are classified as excuses. The law excuses those who, although morally blameworthy, acted in a morally involuntary manner. The act remains wrong, but the author of the offence will not be punished because it was committed in circumstances in which there was realistically no choice. In the same decision, the Court also discussed the use of duress in the context of participation in the activities of a criminal organization. It held as follows: [75] \u2026 Recent jurisprudence has concluded that those who seek to rely on the common law defence of duress cannot do so if they knew that their participation in a conspiracy or criminal association came with a risk of coercion and/or threats to compel them to commit an offence. In this case, the RAD is of the opinion that if the male appellant had demonstrated that his life had been threatened, he would still not be able to successfully use the defence of duress because of his knowledge of the risk of duress or threats by reason of his participation in the cartel\u2019s activities at least since May 2014. According to the facts, as presented by the male appellant himself in his written account and oral testimony, there was an acceptance of the risks. Although he was allegedly approached by the cartel members in May 2010 and therefore did not solicit their collaboration, he did not subsequently try to end this association. On the contrary, he testified that he was satisfied with the various financial arrangements made between 2010 and 2014, and even in June 2018 when they allegedly left him a suitcase containing money, which he took with him when he left his home. Moreover, his alleged attackers employed some known tactics used by members of cartels and criminal organizations, in particular, using a legal pretext to gain a person\u2019s friendship (obtaining information in order to gain trust, then the opening of a fictitious travel agency); refusing to give their real first names and using generic nicknames (baldy, fatty, cousin or the cat); and making rather dubious requests for services (for example, paying him to transport or guard a suitcase with undisclosed contents). These details lead the RAD to believe that the male appellant showed wilful blindness to the criminal nature of his alleged attackers\u2019 activities prior to May 2014, which further detracts from his ability to use the defence of duress. Ultimately, everything suggests that the male appellant knew that his regular participation in the cartel\u2019s activities between 2014 and 2018 carried a risk of duress or threats. Conclusion regarding the seriousness of the nonpolitical crime Having weighed the factors analyzed above, namely, that the appellant allegedly committed a number of offences on behalf of the CJNG (offences that did not, however, involve sexual assault, murder or the abducting members of cartels, but that nevertheless took place over a long period of time and involved at least one offence that would be prosecuted by indictment and liable to a maximum of 14 years\u2019 imprisonment but for which there is no minimum sentence) and that the male appellant has not established that he was acting under duress and that he committed the offences as part of the criminal activities of one of Mexico\u2019s most powerful cartels, the RAD is of the opinion that the non\u2011political crimes the male appellant committed are serious. Conclusion regarding the male appellant\u2019s exclusion For the reasons set out above, the male appellant is a person referred to in Article 1F(b) of the Convention and therefore is neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection under section 98 of the IRPA. The female appellants\u2019 appeals are dismissed Both the refugee protection claims and the appeals made by the female appellants rely on the male appellant\u2019s allegations that, from 2014 to 2018, CJNG members made death threats against all of them if he refused to collaborate. Consequently, their recourse is based on subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. In their memorandum, the female appellants argue that the RPD should have recognized the presumption of truthfulness set out in Maldonado with respect to the allegations that form the basis of their refugee protection claims. However, this presumption \u201cfalls away when there is any reason to \u2018doubt [the] truthfulness\u2019 of a refugee applicant\u2019s claims.\u201d In this case, contrary to the female appellants\u2019 assertion, there are serious doubts as to the credibility of the alleged death threats, and therefore the presumption set out in Maldonado is rebutted. The female appellants\u2019 appeals rely entirely on the male appellant\u2019s testimony. As the RAD has concluded that the male appellant did not demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the CJNG members threatened to kill him, he has necessarily also failed to demonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that death threats were made against the female appellants or that they would be personally subjected to death threats from CJNG members if they returned to Mexico. In their memorandum, the female appellants submit that the RPD should have considered their profile when it hypothesized that although the female appellant had been having poor health because of the strenuous and dangerous conditions faced by her family to leaving the country, they could have taken a taxi to the airport and she could have used a wheelchair there. In the absence of any demonstration concerning the female appellants\u2019 profile or a personal factor that the RPD should have considered, and having analyzed the record as a whole, the RAD cannot accept this ground of appeal because it is not based on specific characteristics of the female appellants\u2019 profiles. Lastly, although their representative did not raise any allegations under section 96 of the IRPA either before the RPD or on appeal, the RAD nevertheless conducted its own analysis of the female appellants\u2019 refugee protection claims and appeals in this regard. They have not established that they would face a serious possibility of persecution on any of the grounds set out in section 96 of the IRPA if they were to return to Mexico. In conclusion, the female appellants failed to demonstrate that if they were to return to Mexico, they would be subjected to a serious possibility of persecution or be subjected personally, on a balance of probabilities, to a danger of torture, to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. CONCLUSION Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(b) of the IRPA, the appeal filed by Mateo Lopez Flores Garcia is dismissed. The RPD\u2019s determination is set aside and the RAD substitutes this determination. The male appellant is a person referred to in Article 1F(b) of the Convention and therefore is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection under section 98 of the IRPA. Pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA, the appeals filed by Maria Jose Lopez Perez, Elena Luna Flores Lopez and Ana Carolina Flores Lopez are dismissed and the RAD confirms the RPD\u2019s determination that the female appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection within the meaning of subsection 97(1) of the IRPA.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200114 Docket: IMM-3479-19 Citation: 2020 FC 41 Ottawa, Ontario, January 14, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice Boswell BETWEEN: RANIA MOHAMED ABDELMONEIM MOHAMED HASHEM Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] The applicant, Mrs. Rania Hashem, applied for a study permit in April 2019 in order to attend a three-year Computer Programming and Analysis program at Seneca College in Toronto, Ontario. The visa section of the Embassy of Canada in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, refused the application in a letter dated May 27, 2019. The two officers who assessed the application were not satisfied Mrs. Hashem would leave Canada at the end of the proposed study period. [2] Mrs. Hashem has now applied under subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], for judicial review of the decision by the visa section. She asks the Court to set aside the decision and return the matter to be reconsidered by a different officer in accordance with the Court\u2019s directions, with the option for her to file new evidence. The issue, therefore, is whether this relief should be granted. I. Background [3] Mrs. Hashem\u2019s application for a study permit was accompanied by applications for study permits for her two minor-aged children since her husband would remain in the United Arab Emirates, where he currently works. Mrs. Hashem is a temporary resident of the United Arab Emirates and her visa to stay there will expire later this year. [4] Mrs. Hashem has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science and has been working as a research manager at the Middle East Broadcasting Centre [MBC] in Abu Dhabi since 2007. As part of her application for a study permit, she submitted a study plan in which she stated her desire to obtain a Diploma in Computer Programming and Analysis at Seneca College to broaden her knowledge in data analytics and to advance in her career. According to Mrs. Hashem, the program she chose was unavailable in the United Arab Emirates. [5] Aside from the study plan, Mrs. Hashem\u2019s application included an email from her employer, stating that MBC encouraged her to travel and pursue a degree in data science and analytics so that she would be in a better position to lead the research department upon her return to MBC. Mrs. Hashem indicated in her application that while studying she would continue to work remotely for MBC on a part-time basis. [6] Mrs. Hashem\u2019s application also contained ownership documentation for the property she owns in Egypt. The offer of admission letter from Seneca College indicated that her program fees and health insurance fee would be approximately CAD $17,952.00 per year. A copy of Mrs. Hashem\u2019s bank statement, showing over CAD $92,000.00 to fund her studies, was included with her study permit application. II. The Visa Section\u2019s Decision [7] The officer who issued the refusal letter was not satisfied Mrs. Hashem would leave Canada at the end of her stay, based on the following grounds: her family ties in Canada and in her country of residence; the purpose of her visit; her current employment situation; her travel history; and her limited employment prospects in her country of residence. The refusal letter invited Mrs. Hashem to reapply if she could respond to these concerns and demonstrate that her situation meets the requirements. [8] The Global Case Management System [GCMS] notes, which form part of the decision (Thedchanamoorthy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 690 at para 17), reflect the concerns outlined in the refusal letter. [9] The first officer (GK03499) who reviewed Mrs. Hashem\u2019s application for a study permit was not satisfied that study was the true purpose of the application. The officer also was not satisfied that the proposed studies would improve Mrs. Hashem\u2019s career prospects to a degree that would offset the costs of studying abroad. This officer considered Mrs. Hashem\u2019s academic and professional history, her financial situation, and her planned studies and the reasons for such studies. The officer was not satisfied that Mrs. Hashem was a genuine student who would pursue studies in Canada. The officer added that the stated benefits of the intended studies did not warrant the costs and difficulty of undertaking a foreign education. This officer was not satisfied that Mrs. Hashem would leave Canada at the end of the period authorized for her stay and refused the application. [10] The second officer (AK25910) who reviewed Mrs. Hashem\u2019s application noted her family ties and economic motives to remain in Canada might outweigh her ties to her home country. In this officer\u2019s view, the study plan appeared vague and poorly documented. The officer accorded less weight to Mrs. Hashem\u2019s employment ties to her country of residence given her current or future employment prospects. Mrs. Hashem\u2019s prior travel history was insufficient to count as a positive factor in the officer\u2019s assessment. This second officer concluded by stating: \u201cWeighing the factors in this application, I am not satisfied that the applicant will depart Canada at the end of the period authorized for their stay\u201d. III. The Parties\u2019 Submissions A. The Applicant\u2019s Submissions [11] Mrs. Hashem says the decision was unreasonable because it ignored or disregarded the evidence concerning her leaving Canada after completing her studies, including evidence of her plan of studies, her ties to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, her job, her properties in Egypt, and her travel history. [12] According to Mrs. Hashem, her plan of study was well documented. She notes that she provided proof of her current work and previous education, as well as justification for undertaking her studies in Canada. She also notes she provided proof of her employer\u2019s support of her studies abroad so that she could be in a better position to lead her department. [13] Mrs. Hashem acknowledges that it is accepted law this Court will presume that all evidence before a decision-maker was considered unless the contrary can be established. According to Mrs. Hashem, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned and specifically analyzed in the reasons, the more willing the Court may be to infer from the silence that the decision-maker made an erroneous finding of fact without regard to the evidence. [14] Mrs. Hashem says a blanket statement that the decision-maker has considered all evidence is insufficient when the evidence omitted from any discussion in the reasons squarely contradicts the decision-maker\u2019s finding of fact. She further says the need to address specific evidence will increase if the evidence is central to the success of the claim. [15] In Mrs. Hashem\u2019s view, the officers ignored or misconstrued her study plan, her employer\u2019s email of support for her studies, her extensive ties to the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, her travel history, and previous compliance with immigration laws. Mrs. Hashem says the officer who found her travel history was insufficient to count as a positive factor erred because travel history should have been considered as a neutral factor. [16] Mrs. Hashem submits that the decision is neither justified nor intelligible. First, the GCMS notes describe her as a 40-year old male who would be accompanied by his wife and kids. Second, the officers did not justify their reasons for concluding that she will not leave Canada following completion of her studies based on the evidence before them. B. The Respondent\u2019s Submissions [17] The respondent notes that subsection 11(1) of the IRPA enables an officer to issue a temporary resident visa if she or he is satisfied that the applicant meets the requirements of the IRPA. The respondent also notes that paragraph 20(1) (b) of the IRPA stipulates that foreign nationals seeking to enter Canada must establish that they intend to leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay. According to the respondent, section 179 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations] reiterates that foreign nationals applying for a temporary resident visa must establish that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay, and this requirement is specifically applied to study permits in section 216 of the Regulations. [18] In the respondent\u2019s view, the officers did not ignore or misconstrue evidence and Mrs. Hashem essentially disagrees with the officers\u2019 weighing of the evidence, which is not a ground for judicial review. According to the respondent, decision-makers are presumed to have considered all the evidence before them unless the contrary is shown, which Mrs. Hashem has failed to do. The respondent says the officers were not obliged to mention every piece of evidence and that Mrs. Hashem\u2019s failure to show the officers ignored evidence amounts to mere disagreement with the factors they found to be determinative. [19] The respondent further says the officers did not ignore or misconstrue the facts regarding Mrs. Hashem\u2019s study plan and how it relates to her future career prospects. In the respondent\u2019s view, Mrs. Hashem provided unclear information about her employment as a research manager and how it relates to her proposed program of study in Canada and made general statements without supporting the connection to her career. [20] According to the respondent, it is unclear how the Seneca College Computer Programming and Analysis program relates to her job. In the respondent\u2019s view, the email provided by Mrs. Hashem\u2019s employer is vague and fails to connect the courses in the program to her current job or future career prospects. The respondent says the potential total costs for tuition, travel, and living expenses would affect the entire savings of Mrs. Hashem\u2019s family without any clear indication as to how the educational program would benefit her future job prospects. [21] The respondent further says the determinative factor in the officers\u2019 decision was that they were not satisfied that Mrs. Hashem would leave Canada at the end of her stay. According to the respondent, Mrs. Hashem failed to demonstrate that she would depart at the end of her authorized stay because she did not show enough connection to Egypt or her place of residence. The respondent notes that Mrs. Hashem has not resided in Egypt since 2006, and her status in the United Arab Emirates will expire in 2020. IV. Analysis [22] The primary issue raised by this application for judicial review is whether the decision by the visa section was reasonable. A. What is the Standard of Review? [23] I agree with the parties that the standard of reasonableness applies to a decision on a study permit application (Patel v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 602 at para 28). [24] The reasonableness standard of review tasks the Court with reviewing an administrative decision for the existence of justification, transparency, and intelligibility within the decision-making process. It also requires the Court to determine whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable, outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para 86 [Vavilov]; Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 at para 47). [25] These criteria are met if the reasons allow the Court to understand why the decision-maker made their decision and enable the Court to determine whether the decision falls within the range of acceptable outcomes (Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses\u2019 Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board), 2011 SCC 62 at para 16). [26] If the process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency, and intelligibility, it is not open to the Court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome; nor is it the function of the reviewing court to reweigh the evidence (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at paras 59 and 61). B. Is the Decision Reasonable? [27] It is not for the Court to reweigh the evidence before the visa section. I agree with the respondent that Mrs. Hashem is essentially asking the Court to reweigh the evidence and to substitute its view for that of the visa section officers. [28] A decision-maker is not obliged to refer explicitly to all the evidence. It is presumed that the decision-maker considered all the evidence in making the decision unless the contrary can be established (Hassan v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration), [1992] FCJ No 946 at para 3; Cepeda-Gutierrez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] 157 FCJ No 1425 at para 16). [29] Mrs. Hashem\u2019s failure to show that the visa section officers ignored evidence amounts to a mere disagreement with the factors they found to be determinative (Boughus v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 210 at paras 56 and 57). There is no reason to intervene and set the decision aside. [30] I agree with the respondent that the determinative factor in the decision was that the visa section officers were not satisfied that Mrs. Hashem would leave Canada at the end of her stay. Mrs. Hashem failed to demonstrate to them that she would depart at the end of her authorized stay because she did not show enough connection to her home country or place of residence. [31] A visa officer must be satisfied that an individual is not inadmissible and that they will leave Canada upon expiration of their visa. As the Court in Chhetri v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 872, observed: [9] \u2026 The combined effect of section 11(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, 2001, c. 27 (IRPA) and Division 3 of Part 11 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (SOR/2002-227) (the Regulations) is to require visa officers to be satisfied that the individuals are not inadmissible and that they will leave Canada on expiry of their visa. It is often over-looked that it must be \u201cestablished\u201d that the foreign national will leave at the end of their visa. The combined effect of the IRPA and the Regulations does not leave much room for officers to give the applicant the benefit of the doubt; rather there is a positive obligation that it be established that the foreign national will leave before the visa be issue. [Emphasis in original] [32] It is true, as Mrs. Hashem points out, that the GCMS notes state, \u201cAccompanied by wife & kids\u201d. This note, however, when read in the context of all the GCMS notes, is immaterial because the notes otherwise make it clear that it was Mrs. Hashem who had applied for the study permit and not her husband. It is also incorrect, in that her application form for the study permit clearly indicates that her husband would not accompany her to Canada. This statement in the GCMS notes is not sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unintelligible or unreasonable (Vavilov at para 100). V. Conclusion [33] The reasons for the decision made by the visa section at the Embassy of Canada in Abu Dhabi are justifiable, intelligible, and transparent; they allow the Court to know the factors considered in making the decision. The decision falls well within the range of acceptable outcomes based on the facts and the law. [34] Mrs. Hashem\u2019s application for judicial review is, therefore, dismissed. [35] Neither party proposed a serious question of general importance to be certified under paragraph 74(d) of the IRPA; so, no such question is certified. JUDGMENT in IMM-3469-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: the application for judicial review is dismissed; and there is no order as to costs. \"Keith M.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200121 Docket: IMM-2894-19 Citation: 2020 FC 89 Winnipeg, Manitoba, January 21, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Madam Justice Strickland BETWEEN: ABOLFAZL EBRAHIMSHANI Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] This is an application for judicial review of a decision by a visa officer with the Visa Section of the Embassy of Canada in Warsaw, Poland, denying the Applicant\u2019s application, pursuant to s 100(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 (IRP Regs), for permanent residence in the self-employed persons class. Background [2] The Applicant, Abolfazl Ebrahimshani, is a citizen of Iran. He applied for permanent residency in Canada in November 2017, in the economic class as a self-employed person. In his application, he describes himself having worked as a self-employed artist since December 2014. His artistic endeavors include sculpting, designing carpets, and designing book and CD covers. Prior to this, he was a project manager for the restoration of a historical property. The occupation in which he intends to be self-employed is to establish an art gallery where he can design carpets and sculptures for sale and hold workshops. With his application, the Applicant also submitted a business plan. The visa officer denied the application on the basis that the Applicant had failed to establish that he had or could meet the definition of a self-employed person as set out in s 88(1) of the IRP Regs. This is the judicial review of that decision. Decision under review [3] In the March 7, 2019 decision letter the visa officer indicated that, pursuant to s 12(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), a foreign national may be selected as a member of the economic class on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada. Further, that for the purposes of s 12(2) of the IRPA, s 100(2) of the IRPA Regs states that the self-employed persons class is a prescribed class of person who may become permanent residents based on their ability to become economically established in Canada and who are self-employed persons within the meaning of s 88(1). Section 88(1) defines a self-employed person as a foreign national who has relevant experience and has the intention and ability to be self-employed in Canada and to make a significant contribution to specified economic activities in Canada. Pursuant to s 100(2) of the IRP Regs, if such applicants are not self-employed persons as defined by s 88(1), then the application shall be refused and no further assessment required. [4] The visa officer was not satisfied that the Applicant met the definition of a self-employed person because, based on the submitted evidence, he had not established that he had the ability and intent to become self-employed in Canada. Consequently, the Applicant was not eligible to receive a permanent resident visa as a member of the self-employed persons class. [5] The Global Case Management System notes (GCMS Notes) form a part of the reasons for the decision (De Hoedt Daniel v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1391 at para 51; Afridi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 193 at para 20; Muthui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 105 at para 3). These indicate that the Applicant submitted that he is a self-employed sculptor in Iran and that he would like to establish his own gallery in Canada where he would design carpets and sculptures for sale, and hold workshops. In the GCMS notes the visa officer records that the Applicant\u2019s submissions in support of the application were reviewed, including his business plan. Further, that information about the Applicant\u2019s intended self-employment in Canada is reflected in the application and business plan. However, that the Applicant featured only a brief description of his intended self-employment. The business plan provides general information about the business in the related field in Canada. It also states that the Applicant would like to open an art gallery in Canada where he could design and exhibit his own works, and organize some events, including workshops. The business plan provides some financial figure projections, however, the basis for the figures was unclear. The business plan also includes high level, general, open source information about the industry in Canada as a whole, with only a modest amount of information on Toronto and the surrounding area where the Applicant intends to settle. The visa officer indicated that there was insufficient information that the Applicant has actually made any contacts in Canada in order to research the feasibility of the proposed business and no evidence of an exploratory visit. The visa officer found that the Applicant provided insufficient evidence to show that he had done in depth research of the Canadian market, specifically the city of destination, in his proposed business activity field, and that his plan would reasonably be expected to lead to future self-employment and penetration of the market in the field of the Applicant\u2019s intended self employment. The visa officer was not satisfied that the Applicant had the ability and intent to become self-employed in Canada. Issues [6] The Applicant submits that the visa officer unreasonably found that the Applicant\u2019s business plan was too general, and breached procedural fairness in failing to provide the Applicant with an opportunity to respond to the visa officer\u2019s concerns. The Respondent submits that the only issue for judicial review is whether it was reasonable for the visa officer to conclude the Applicant had not established that he had the intention or ability to become self-employed in Canada. [7] I would reframe the issues as follows: Did the visa officer breach the Applicant\u2019s right to procedural fairness? Was the visa officer\u2019s decision reasonable? Standard of review [8] In his written representations, the Applicant made no specific submissions as to the standard of review. The Respondent submitted that the standard of review is reasonableness because permanent residency decisions by visa officers involve questions of fact, and visa officers have recognized expertise. [9] Subsequent to the parties filing their written submissions, the Supreme Court of Canada issued its decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (Vavilov) in which that Court revisits the standard of review applicable to administrative decisions. Accordingly, at the hearing of this application for judicial review, I inquired if the parties wished to make any additional submissions arising from Vavilov and concerning the standard of review applicable in this matter. [10] Counsel agreed that reasonableness continues to be the appropriate standard of review when assessing the merits of a visa officer\u2019s decision. The Applicant submitted that correctness is the standard to be applied to the question of procedural fairness. Procedural Fairness [11] In Mission Institution v Khela, 2014 SCC 24 at para 79 and in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para 43 the Supreme Court found that questions of procedural fairness are reviewed on a correctness standard. In Vavilov, the Court does not explicitly state whether questions of procedural fairness will continue to be reviewed on a correctness standard. However, in establishing reasonableness as the presumptive standard of review for most questions on judicial review, the Supreme Court\u2019s framework was concerned with circumstances where \u201cthe merits of an administrative decision are challenged\u201d (Vavilov at para 16). And, at paragraph 23, the Court indicated that a challenge on the merits is not one that relates to natural justice or procedural fairness: 23 Where a court reviews the merits of an administrative decision (i.e., judicial review of an administrative decisions other than a review related to a breach of natural justice and/or the duty of procedural fairness), the standard of review it applies must reflect the legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the role of the reviewing court, except where giving effect to that intent is precluded by the rule of law. The starting point for the analysis is a presumption that the legislature intended the standard of review to be reasonableness. [12] On this basis, in my view, prior jurisprudence that establishes correctness as the standard of review for questions related to procedural fairness is still authoritative. [13] I do not agree with the oral submission of counsel for the Applicant that, as I understood it, based on paragraph 58 of Vavilov the correctness standard has application to the question of procedural fairness that the Applicant raises because this is a general question of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole. That is not what paragraph 58 indicates. However, for the above reasons, I agree that the correctness standard remains applicable to questions of procedural fairness, I therefore need not further address this submission. Merits [14] As to the merits of the decision, Vavilov established a presumption that reasonableness is the applicable standard whenever a Court reviews an administrative decision (Vavilov at paras 16, 23, 25). That presumption can be rebutted in two types of situations. The first being where the legislature explicitly prescribes the applicable standard of review or where it has provided a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative decision to a court. The second being when the rule of law requires that the standard of correctness be applied. This will be the case in certain categories of questions, namely, constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, questions regarding jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies, or any other category that may subsequently be recognized as exceptional and also requiring review on the correctness standard (Vavilov at paras 17, 69). [15] The majority in Vavilov held that, \u201cit is the very fact that the legislature has chosen to delegate authority which justifies a default position of reasonableness review\u201d (Vavilov at para 30, emphasis original). In this matter, the presumptive reasonableness standard applies because the visa officer has the delegated authority to make the decision under review and because none of the circumstances exist which might rebut that presumption. [16] The Supreme Court in Vavilov also addressed how a reasonableness review should be conducted by a reviewing court (paras 73-145). In that regard, the Supreme Court held that \u201c[i]n order to fulfill Dunsmuir\u2019s promise to protect \u2018the legality, the reasonableness and the fairness of the administrative process and its outcomes\u2019, reasonableness review must entail a sensitive and respectful, but robust, evaluation of administrative decisions: para. 28\u201d (Vavilov at para 12). The reviewing court must consider the outcome of the administrative decision in light of its underlying rationale in order to ensure that the decision as a whole is transparent, intelligible and justified (Vavilov at para 15). Preliminary Issue \u2013 Lack of Personal Affidavit [17] At the leave stage, the Respondent made submissions concerning the fact that the Applicant did not file a personal affidavit in support of his application for judicial review, including that this irregularity alone was a sufficient basis upon which the Court could dismiss the application. When appearing before me, the Respondent did not pursue that aspect of its submissions but maintained that, even if the absence of a personal affidavit was not fatal, where there is no evidence based on personal knowledge filed in support of an application for judicial review, any error asserted by the Applicant must appear on the face of the record. The Respondent submits that the Applicant has not done this. [18] The Applicant submits that an application for judicial review need not be dismissed for want of a proper affidavit where the affidavit that was submitted is sufficient to establish the fact of the application and its rejection (Zheng v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 1152 at para 5; Turcinovica v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 164 at paras 11-14 (Turcinovica)). [19] In this matter, the only affidavit filed was that of Ms. Helia Hazaei, who states that she is an assistant in the office of the Applicant\u2019s previous counsel that assisted the Applicant with his immigration matters. As such, she has personal knowledge of the facts deposed to therein. However, the affidavit deposes to no facts other than stating that attached as Exhibit A is a copy of the application for permanent residence that was submitted by her office on behalf of the Applicant. [20] An affidavit supporting an application for judicial review in an immigration matter is one of the primary sources of information from which the Court gains an understanding of the Applicant\u2019s concerns with the decision making process (Zhang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 491at para 14 (Zhang 2017)). Where a supporting affidavit is not provided by an applicant, the application for judicial review is incomplete and the Court may dismiss the application on that basis (Dhillon v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 614 at para 9). Where an affidavit is, as here, provided not by an applicant but by a legal assistant and merely confirms that an application seeking permanent residency was filed, this Court may afford it no probative value or weight (Dhillon at para 10; Zhang 2017 at para 14). Further, where there is no evidence based on personal knowledge filed in support of an application for judicial review, any error asserted by the applicant must appear on the face of the record (Turcinovica at para 14). [21] In this matter, the Hazaei affidavit merely serves to confirm that an application for permanent residence was submitted on behalf of the Applicant. The Applicant\u2019s record provided the decision rejecting the application. In this circumstance, I will not dismiss the application for judicial review simply on the basis that a personal affidavit of the Applicant was not provided. However, I note that the Hazaei affidavit is problematic for other reasons. First, the attached immigration application was actually filed by Masoud Feiz of World Wide Immigration Services Inc., which would appear to be an immigration consultant, not counsel, as Ms. Hazaei states in her affidavit. More significantly, and as pointed out by the Respondent, some of the wording in the business plan attached to the affidavit differs from the wording of the business plan found in the Certified Tribunal Record (CTR). There is no explanation for this. This brings into question Ms. Hazaei\u2019s personal knowledge of the content of the immigration application that was submitted by her office on behalf of the Applicant. [22] In these circumstances, the affidavit serves to establish only that the application for permanent residency was filed. I will otherwise afford the affidavit and its content no probative value and will rely only on the CTR. Further, the errors asserted by the Applicant must appear on the face of that record. Issue 1: Did the visa officer breach the Applicant\u2019s right to procedural fairness? Applicant\u2019s Position [23] The Applicant\u2019s submissions are contradictory in some respects but boil down to the position that a failure to provide an applicant with an opportunity to respond to a visa officer\u2019s concerns is a breach of procedural fairness, particularly where an officer\u2019s concerns relate to the credibility, accuracy or genuineness of the information submitted by the applicant (Hassani v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 1283 at para 24 (Hassani)). [24] The Applicant submits that the visa officer\u2019s findings do not relate to the sufficiency of evidence, which would not entitle the Applicant to an opportunity to address their concerns. He submits that the evidence was there but the officer found it was too general, had questions as to its source and ultimately did not believe that the Applicant had the ability and intent to be self-employed in Canada. According to the Applicant, the visa officer\u2019s concerns could not have been anticipated and should have afforded him an opportunity to address them. [25] Further, that questioning the source of evidence is tantamount to questioning its credibility, and that procedural fairness required that the Applicant should have been given an opportunity to disabuse the visa officer of those concerns. Respondent\u2019s Position [26] The Respondent submits that the duty of procedural fairness owed by the visa officer was at the low end of the spectrum and there is no obligation on a visa officer to notify applicants of deficiencies with their documentation or provide them opportunities to respond (Tollerene v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 538 (Tollerene)). Further, applicants bear the burden of adducing sufficient evidence in support of their application so as to establish that they have met the visa requirements (IRPA s 22(1); Guryeva v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1103 at para 5; Kameli v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 772 at para 17). Specifically, applicants claiming permanent residence in the self-employed persons class have to show their ability and intent to become economically established in Canada (IRP Regs ss 88(1), 100(1)-(2); Pourkazemi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 8830 at para 16). The Applicant simply did not meet his burden. Analysis [27] In Hamza v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 264 (Hamza), Justice B\u00e9dard provided a helpful summary of the law which has application in this matter: [22] First, the onus clearly falls on the applicant to establish that he or she meets the requirements of the Regulations by providing sufficient evidence in support of his or her application (El Sherbiny v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 69 at para 6 (available on CanLII) [El Sherbiny]; Enriquez, above at para 8; Torres, above at paras 37-40; Kaur v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 758 at para 30 (available on CanLII) [Kaur]; Oladipo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 366 at para 24, 166 ACWS (3d) 355; Ismaili, above, at para 18. [23] Second, the duty of procedural fairness owed by visa officers is on the low end of the spectrum (Farooq v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 164 at para 10 (available on CanLII) [Farooq]; Sandhu, above at para 25; Trivedi v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 2010 FC 422 at para 39 (available on CanLII) [Trivedi]; Khan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCA 345 at paras 30-32, [2002] 2 FC 413; Patel v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 55 at para 10, 288 NR 48; Chiau v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), [2001] 2 FC 297 at para 41 (available on CanLII) (CA), leave to appeal to SCC refused, 28418 (August 16, 2001). [24] Third, a visa officer has neither an obligation to notify an applicant of inadequacies in his or her application nor in the material provided in support of the application. Furthermore, a visa officer has no obligation to seek clarification or additional documentation, or to provide an applicant with an opportunity to address his or her concerns, when the material provided in support of an application is unclear, incomplete or insufficient to convince the officer that the applicant meets all the requirements that stem from the Regulations (Hassani, above at paras 23-24; Patel, above at para 21; El Sherbiny, above at para 6; Sandhu, above at para, 25; Luongo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 618 at para 18 (available on CanLII); Ismaili, above at para 18; Triveldi, above at para 42; Singh, above at para 40; Sharma v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 786 at para 8, 179 ACWS (3d) 912 [Sharma]). [25] Nevertheless, a duty to provide an applicant with the opportunity to respond to an officer\u2019s concerns may arise when the officer is concerned with the credibility, the veracity, or the authenticity of the documentation provided by an applicant as opposed to the sufficiency of the evidence provided. This latter point stems from Hassani, where Justice Mosley held: 24 \u2026it is clear that where a concern arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns. Where however the issue is not one that arises in this context, such a duty may arise. This is often the case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer\u2019s concern, as was the case in Rukmangathan, and in John and Cornea cited by the Court in Rukmangathan, above. [28] More recently, in Lv v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 935, Justice Gascon also provided a summary of the principles of procedural fairness in the context of decisions made by visa officers: [22] It is well-established that an immigration officer\u2019s duty on an application or permanent residence under a specific class (such as the self-employed class sought by Mr. Lv) is relaxed. As correctly stated by the Minister, the duty of procedural fairness generally owed in an application for a permanent resident visa is located towards the lower end of the range (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Patel, 2002 FCA 55 at para 10; Kamchibekov v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 1411 at para 23). More specifically, in the context of a visa officer\u2019s decision on an application for permanent residence, the duty of fairness is quite low and easily met, \u201cdue to the absence of a legal right to permanent residence, the fact that the burden is on the applicant to establish [his] eligibility, the less serious impact on the applicant that the decision typically has, compared with the removal of a benefit, and the public interest in containing administrative costs\u201d (Tahereh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 90 at para 12). The onus is on visa applicants to put together applications that are convincing, to anticipate adverse inferences contained in the evidence and address them, and to demonstrate that they have a right to enter Canada (Hassani at paras 21, 26). Procedural fairness does not arise whenever an officer has concerns that an applicant could not reasonably have anticipated (Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 526 at para 52). [23] In the context of permanent residence applications, an immigration officer has no legal obligation to seek to clarify a deficient application, to reach out and make the applicant\u2019s case, to apprise an applicant of concerns relating to whether the requirements set out in the legislation have been met, to provide the applicant with a running score at every step of the application process, or to offer further opportunities to respond to continuing concerns or deficiencies (Bhatti v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 186 at para 46; Sharma v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 786 at para 8; Mazumder v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 444 at para 14; Kumari v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FC 1424 at para 7; Fernandez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] FCJ No 994 (QL) at para 13; Dhillon v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] FCJ No 574 (QL) at paras 3-4). To impose such an obligation on a visa officer would be akin to giving advance notice of a negative decision, an obligation that has been expressly rejected by this Court on many occasions (Penez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 1001 at para 37; Tofangchi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 427 at para 45; Ahmed v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] FCJ No 940 (QL) at para 8). (Also see Jafari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), IMM-6099-19 at para 14 [Unpublished Oral Decision dated July 24 2019] (Jafari); Tollerene at para 15). [29] I am not persuaded by the Applicant\u2019s argument that the visa officer raised concerns that did not stem from the IRP Regs, or made comments tantamount to questioning the credibility of the Applicant\u2019s submissions. Nor are the visa officer\u2019s concerns ones that the Applicant could not reasonably have anticipated. [30] First, the onus was on the Applicant to demonstrate that he was in compliance with all of the applicable eligibility requirements in order to be afforded a permanent residence visa (IRP Regs, ss 88(1), 100(1)-(2); IRPA, s 12(2)). The visa officer\u2019s decision was explicitly concerned with whether the Applicant provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate his ability and intent to be self-employed in Canada. The requirement for an applicant to have the ability and intent to be self-employed in Canada is found in s 88(1) and s 100(1) of the IRP Regs. The concerns, therefore, stemmed from the applicable regulations. [31] Further, in the GCMS Notes the visa officer stated the concern that the evidence supplied by the Applicant was insufficient because it was brief, general, and/or lacking justification. In my view, comments as to the brevity or generality of evidence are comments directed at the sufficiency of evidence, and they are not disguised credibility assessments. I agree with the Respondent that the visa officer\u2019s decision hinged on the sufficiency of evidence and did not give rise to a duty of procedural fairness to provide the Applicant with the opportunity to respond. [32] As to the Applicant\u2019s submission that questioning the source of the Applicant\u2019s evidence was tantamount to questioning its credibility, thus giving rise duty to provide the Applicant with an opportunity to respond to the concern, I do not agree. The visa officer\u2019s reference to the source of the Applicant\u2019s information was made in the context of the finding that the Applicant\u2019s submissions contained \u201chigh-level, open source information\u201d. There is nothing in the visa officer\u2019s reasons suggesting that the visa officer was of the view that open source information is unreliable or not credible. A review of the reasons as a whole makes it clear that the Officer was commenting on the sufficiency of the information provided by the Applicant intended to show that the Applicant had the ability and intention to become self-employed in Canada, and that general, open source information was insufficient to support the Applicant\u2019s business plan. The visa officer\u2019s concern was not one of credibility of the sources, which included Justice Canada and the Statistics Canada website, and the officer was under no duty to provide the Applicant with an opportunity to address the visa officer\u2019s concerns as to the sufficiency of the Applicant\u2019s evidence. [33] Additionally, the visa officer\u2019s concerns were with the generality of the business plan. As discussed below, this included the unclear basis for the financial figures provided and a lack of information and market research relevant to the location where the Applicant intended to open his business. In my view, it could reasonably have been anticipated that the absence of this information and reliance upon general information from open sources could be considered insufficient to establish that the Applicant had the ability and the intent to be self-employed in Canada. [34] In short, the Applicant had the burden of adducing sufficient evidence to support his application. The Officer was not required to alert the Applicant to any insufficiency with his documentation submitted as part of his application. The visa officer\u2019s findings related to the sufficiency of evidence provided by the Applicant and stemmed from the IRP Regs. The visa officer did not breach the Applicant\u2019s right to procedural fairness by failing to give the Applicant an opportunity to respond to the visa officer\u2019s concerns about the sufficiency of the evidence. Issue 2: Was the visa officer\u2019s decision reasonable? Applicant\u2019s Position [35] The Applicant submits that his business plan identified the nature of the proposed self-employed business; discussed the particular market that the Applicant seeks to enter; outlined how his personal competencies \u2013 which are well documented in his resume and documentary materials \u2013make him a good candidate to run a profitable venture in the said market; detailed potential competition and possible competitors in geographic proximity to his business; and, listed events that he could attend to promote his business, particularly in Richmond Hill. The business plan also provided information on projected staffing, the specific location and projected cost for leasing a space in the area; as well as projected and detailed costs over four years. Further, the Applicant\u2019s Schedule 6A form demonstrated that the Applicant has a total of $774,238 in assets, of which $290,159 was in funds, and that he would have $300,000 available to start his business. Given this, the Applicant submits that refusal of his application on the basis that the visa officer believed that the business plan was too general and not detailed enough was not reasonable. [36] The Applicant also argues that there is nothing improper with open source information and that it is hard to understand what is wrong with relying on general online sources. The Applicant also disputes the Respondent\u2019s reliance on jurisprudence holding that the applicants in those cases had failed to do the necessary research to demonstrate the viability of their venture on the basis that he had done so. [37] Further, the Applicant submits that the officer mistakenly identified Toronto, as opposed to Richmond Hill, as the Applicant\u2019s intended place of business. Respondent\u2019s Position [38] The Respondent submits that, before a visa applicant can immigrate to Canada under the self-employed persons class, s 88(1) of the IRP Regs requires that they demonstrate that they have met three specified requirements, being that they have relevant experience, the intention and ability to be self-employed in Canada, and the intention and ability to make a significant contribution to the specified economic activities in Canada. [39] The visa officer\u2019s finding that the Applicant\u2019s business plan referenced high-level open source information was reasonable because the \u201cReferences\u201d section of the business plan confirms that the information came from general online sources. Further, the officer reasonably found that the Applicant did not provide any basis for the figures asserted in his business plan. [40] Additionally, the jurisprudence is clear that it was open to the visa officer to find that a lack of research by the Applicant to demonstrate the viability of his proposed self-employment activity could reasonably lead to the application being denied. Accordingly, it was reasonable for the officer to conclude that the brief description of the proposed business venture, coupled with a general business plan, did not support an intention and ability to be self-employed in Canada. Analysis [41] The officer found that the business plan provided some financial figures and projections. However, that the basis for those figures was unclear. A review of the business plan that was in the record before the visa officer confirms this finding. For example, under the heading \u201cproject costs, funding, and financials\u201d, the Applicant states that starting his business will cost approximately $250,000 but does not provide the basis for that figure or data explaining that start-up cost. Also included is a graph, said to depict a \u201cBreak-Event [sic] Analysis\u201d over four years, but there is no information substantiating the graph. The Applicant also submitted charts following his Business plan with more detailed cost-breakdowns, but those charts again provide only figures; there is no basis for the figures. The charts also contain general information. For example, under the \u201cStart-up Costs\u201d chart, the Applicant allocates $15,000 for \u201cequipment\u201d, the only description of this equipment being that it is \u201cnecessary to run the operations\u201d. There is also an entry for an \u201copening inventory\u201d of $3,400, the only explanation of this being \u201cTo start operation\u201d. The chart for \u201cSales\u201d projects that the gallery will have sales of $100,000 in Year 1, $140,000 in Year 2 and $200,000 in year 3, but no basis for those projections is provided. Looking to the record, therefore, it can be understood why the officer found that the Applicant\u2019s business plan lacked a basis for the provided financial figures and projections. The absence of a sound basis for those figures and projections for the Applicant\u2019s proposed business contributed to the officer\u2019s finding that the Applicant had not demonstrated that he has the ability and intent to become self-employed in Canada. [42] The visa officer also found that the business plan includes high level, general, open source information about the area of industry in Canada as a whole with only a modest amount of information on Toronto and the surrounding area where the Applicant intends to settle. [43] In that regard, a review of the business plan indicates that the intended location of the business is in Richmond Hill. While the Applicant submits the visa officer misconstrued the evidence as to the location of the intended business as being Toronto, he does not elaborate on this or suggest that it was a reviewable error. Nor did the officer state that the intended location of the business was Toronto. Rather, in assessing the content of the business plan, the visa officer noted that it contained a modest amount of information \u201con Toronto and the surrounding area, where the applicant intends to settle\u201d. Richmond Hill is part of the surrounding area. [44] A review of the business plan also confirms that much of it is, indeed, general in nature. For example, there is a section entitled \u201cRegulations\u201d. This informs that before registering a company, a name search must be conducted, and if the name is already in use, the new company will not be able to legally register under that name. Further, that according to Justice Canada, there are rules and regulations, which would have to be complied by any business in this field of activity. This statement is followed by a list of references that may or may not be relevant to the proposed business, such as general Import Permit No. 100 \u2013 Eligible Agriculture Goods. Reference is then made to the Canadian Labour Program website as containing a comprehensive list of rules and regulations. The business plan also notes that on the Canada Business Network there is a list of related regulations in the areas of Regulated Business Activities, Standards, and Regulated Industries, which also needs to be considered, and points out that regulations for Ontario can be found at a specified website. The business plan states that a legal advisor will be used to ensure regulatory and other compliance. Under the \u201cReferences\u201d section of the business plan are listed Canada business, Statistics Canada Website, Industry Canada Data base, Industry Canada Benchmarking Tool, Justice Canada, and the yellow pages Canada website. [45] Similarly, the \u201cIndustry Analysis\u201d (which is, in fact, not contained in the version of the business plan found in the CTR) indicates that the proposed company would slot into the North American Industry Classification System under code 45392, Art Dealers. That industry is comprised of establishments primarily engaged in retailing original and limited edition art works. The proposed new company would also provide design services to carpet and rug mills. The analysis states that based on information found on the Industry Canada website, there are more than 100 establishments active in manufacturing carpets and rugs in Canada and the volume of import for that product exceeds $800 million. And, that according to Canadian Financial Performance Data, there are 1389 establishments in Canada in the field of art gallery and dealership of original art-works. Their average revenue is $314,300 annually with 72.7% of the companies in that field being profitable. In Ontario, there are 359 such companies with an average revenue of $265,600 with 74.7% being profitable. The market size of the industry in Ontario is approximately $95.3 million. The business plan states that these statistics suggest that the industry is strong. [46] And, under \u201cCompetition and Competitive Advantage\u201d, the business plan re-states that the market size of this industry in Ontario is approximately $95.3 million annually and that the average revenue of establishments in this industry is approximately $314,000 annually. The business plan states that the owner expects the company to reach this industry average within a period of 3 to 4 years based on the competency of the Applicant \u2013 being his past experience and his expectation that a large part of his clientele will be Middle Eastern people with whom he has a shared cultural familiarity \u2013 as well as the competencies of the new company. Competencies of the new company include that it will position itself as a specialist in carpet and rug design distinguishing it from its competitors, and that the quality of its work will assist in attaining customer trust and retention. The plan lists eight companies, found in Toronto, Mississauga and Richmond Hill, that are identified as potential competitors, noting that none of them provide the same combination of services (gallery, carpet design service and craft workshop) as proposed by the Applicant. [47] In my view, as demonstrated by the examples above, the visa officer reasonably found that the information provided by the business plan is general, high level, open source information. And, while the officer found this information concerned the area of industry in Canada as a whole with only a modest amount of information on Toronto and the surrounding area where the Applicant intends to settle, it might be more accurate to say that the information concerning both Canada and Ontario was high level, general and open source. Regardless, there was no information about the number and performance of galleries in Toronto and surrounding areas, including Richmond Hill. Further, the Applicant only discusses Toronto and the surrounding area in his business plan with respect to industry competition (listing 8 galleries), events for advertising (4 festivals and \u201cChristmas Events\u201d) and available retail space. Nor does the \u201cIndustry Analysis\u201d, if it was included in the business plan submitted by the Applicant, concern Toronto or the surrounding area. [48] The visa officer also found that the Applicant had provided insufficient information that he had actually made any contacts in Canada in order to research the feasibility of the proposed business and that there was no evidence of an exploratory visit. Given this, the officer concluded that the Applicant had not established that he had done in-depth research of the Canadian market, specifically the city of destination, in his proposed business activity field, or that he had adopted a plan that would reasonably be expected to lead to future self-employment and penetrate the market in that field. [49] As stated in Singh Sahota v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 856 (Sahota), it is not unreasonable for a visa officer to explore a business plan to assess the applicant's knowledge of the business environment and the cost of doing business (Sahota at para 13). These questions are relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the applicant's intentions and his ability to carry out those intentions. If the plan is not realistic or is excessively vague, the applicant is unlikely to meet the requirements for an entrepreneur immigrant (Sahota at para 13; also see Singh v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2018 FC 84 at paras 34, 36, 38). Nor was it an error for the visa officer to consider the fact that the Applicant had not conducted an exploratory visit to Canada. As in Sahota, it is apparent from a reading of the reasons as a whole that the visa officer did not view this as fatal in and of itself (Sahota at para 12). Rather, it was one of the factors that contributed to the ultimate finding that the Applicant failed to establish that he had the intention and ability to become self-employed in Canada. [50] Further, a lack of research with respect to the proposed venture can also justify a finding that the plan was not viable (Sahota at para 14, referencing Shehada v Canada (Citizenship and Immigrations), 2004 FC 11 at para 7 (Shehada)). And, while in both Sahota and Shehada an interview had been held during which the applicants therein were given an opportunity to explain their business proposals, in my view, the fact that the visa officer did not do so in this case does not change this general principle. [51] Further, \u201ca measure of precision\u201d is required in order to satisfy the test of the ability to become economically established in Canada, and every such application must demonstrate that the proposed venture has been \u201cthoroughly conceived and concrete steps taken to ensure the implementation that will result in the successful economic activity to meet the requirements of self-employed immigrant under section 88(1)\u201d (Gur v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1275 at para 18 referencing Wei v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 982 at para 44). [52] The Applicant may well be talented and have funds available to him to finance his endeavour, however, to be granted a visa his application and submitted materials were required to demonstrate that he had the intention and ability to be self-employed in Canada. The application form notes that it is important that applicants complete the form fully and accurately and that the information provided will be used to gauge applicant\u2019s ability to meet the requirements of the IRPA and the IRP Regs as they apply to the self-employed persons class. The Applicant\u2019s permanent residence application, in describing the occupation in which he intended to be self employed, stated only that he intended to establish an art gallery where he could design carpets and sculptures for sale and hold workshops. It appears that the Applicant elected to submit the business plan to provide all of the detail to support his proposed business and the visa officer found that it contained insufficient evidence. In other words, the Applicant failed to meet his burden. Moreover, the Applicant\u2019s argument that his business plan was detailed enough is, in effect, asking this Court to reweigh the evidence, which is not its role (Qaddafi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 629 at para 59). [53] In conclusion, in my view, the visa officer\u2019s concern that the business plan lacked sufficient information about the basis for his financial information, relied on high level, general open source materials and lacked area-specific research was justified and reasonable, as was the visa officer\u2019s conclusion that the Applicant had not established that he has the intent and ability to become self-employed in Canada (Jafari at paras 29-30). This is because, having considered the visa officer\u2019s reasons in conjunction with the record, I am satisfied that the visa officer\u2019s reasoning process was sound. Further, that the visa officer\u2019s decision was justified in relation to the facts before the officer, as provided in the Applicant\u2019s documentary submissions, and in relation to the requirements for self-employed permanent residents as found in IRPA and the IRP Regs. The decision meets the hallmarks of reasonableness: justifiability, transparency, and intelligibility (Vavilov at para 99). JUDGMENT in IMM-2894-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The application for judicial review is dismissed; There shall be no order as to costs; and No question of general importance for certification was proposed or arises. \u201cCecily Y.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TC100162 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Faaid Khokhar Arvin Pirzada (Appellant) is a citizen of Pakistan. He appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting his claim for refugee protection. DECISION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. BACKGROUND The Appellant\u2019s allegations are as follows. The Appellant alleges that he fears persecution at the hands of a man, Teymoor, due to the Appellant\u2019s refusal to sell him land, which resulted in a confrontation, following which Teymoor filed a First Information Report (FIR) accusing him of blasphemy related to his Shia faith. As a result, the Appellant fears persecution from Teymoor in addition to the Pakistani state. The RPD heard the Appellant\u2019s refugee claim on November 18, 2020. On December 18, 2020, the RPD rejected the claim on the basis of credibility. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment by relying on assumptions and speculation rather than evidence and ignoring the totality of the evidence. The determinative issue on appeal is credibility. NO NEW EVIDENCE, NO ORAL HEARING The Appellant does not request to submit new evidence on appeal, nor does he request an oral hearing. As there is no new evidence admitted on appeal, there can be no oral hearing pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). ROLE OF THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION (RAD) The RAD applies a standard of correctness for questions of fact, mixed fact and law, and law. I may defer to the RPD in assessing findings involving the credibility of oral testimony if I find that it had a meaningful advantage in the circumstances. In this case, I find that the RPD did not have a meaningful advantage. ANALYSIS The RPD\u2019s reasons are not based on assumptions or speculation nor do they rely on minor or peripheral inconsistencies The Appellant submits that the RPD based its refusal on assumptions. The Appellant refers to the RPD\u2019s reasons stating that the Appellant did not establish that the FIR was issued against him or that he has a forward-facing threat. The Appellant submits that this statement ignores the fact that there is a copy of the FIR in evidence, that the Appellant refers to the FIR in his Basis of Claim (BOC) and testimony, and that the affidavits of family and friends mention the FIR. The Appellant refers to Federal Court jurisprudence stating that decisions in which findings of fact are made without regard to the evidence or that ignore evidence and are material to a credibility finding will generally be overturned. The Appellant submits that the RPD raised issues that are not material to the claim. The Appellant refers to the RPD mentioning that the Appellant\u2019s friend\u2019s affidavit does not refer to his clothes being torn off. The Appellant refers to Federal Court jurisprudence for the proposition that adverse credibility findings must be based on real contradictions, be significant, and material to the claim. The Appellant refers to Federal Court jurisprudence for the proposition that minor or peripheral inconsistencies in a claimant\u2019s evidence should not lead to a finding of general lack of credibility where the documentary evidence supports the plausibility of a claimant\u2019s story. I reject the Appellant\u2019s submission that the RPD\u2019s determination that he did not establish that the FIR was issued against him is based on assumptions or ignores the fact that there is a copy of the FIR in evidence and that it is referred to in other evidence, including the Appellant\u2019s BOC form and testimony and the affidavits. Contrary to the Appellant\u2019s submissions, the RPD acknowledged that there was a copy of the FIR on file and that it is referred to in other evidence, however noted that there were a number of issues regarding the FIR. The RPD noted that the Appellant was unsure as to how and when his wife obtained the FIR. The RPD considered the Appellant\u2019s explanation for not knowing this information, namely that he was unsure how and when she obtained it and found his explanation unreasonable. The RPD noted that it is reasonable to expect that, if the FIR was given to the Appellant\u2019s wife on the date of the police visit on February 12, 2019, she would have mentioned it to him when she spoke to him following the visit. The RPD found that it was reasonable to expect the Appellant to know how and when the FIR was obtained and drew a negative inference. The RPD noted that the FIR is central to the core of the Appellant\u2019s claim. The RPD also found that the Appellant omitted subsequent police visits from his BOC narrative. The RPD noted that the Appellant testified that his wife and daughters remain in their home in Karachi and have not had any issues since January 2019 then later testified that the police have visited their home since February 24, 2019 but that he did not know when. The RPD put the omission of these visits from his BOC narrative to the Appellant, to which he responded that he was not thinking logically. The RPD found the Appellant\u2019s explanation unreasonable as he alleges that there is an active FIR against him for which he is wanted by the police and noted that any subsequent visits by police searching for him are central to the core of the Appellant\u2019s claim. The RPD found it reasonable to expect the continued pursuit of police to be included in the BOC narrative if it occurred as alleged. The RPD found that the Appellant had not established, on a balance of probabilities, that the police continue to look for him in Karachi. The RPD also noted that the Appellant testified that Teymoor never contacted him after January 9, 2019 and that he was unaware of any visits thereafter. He testified that he never looked into the status of the FIR because he was not there and did not want to contact them. The RPD considered the objective documentary evidence which states that once an FIR is registered, police are bound to investigate unless they provide written reasons for not doing so and that cancelling an FIR is extremely difficult. Considering this, that the Appellant had not established an ongoing pursuit by police, that fraudulent documents, including FIRs, are readily available in Pakistan, the RPD assigned the FIR no weight and found, on a balance of probabilities, that he did not establish that an FIR had been issued against him, that he is wanted by police or that Teymoor continues to look for him. The RPD found that the Appellant failed to establish a forward-facing risk as a result of the blasphemy allegations. After reviewing the RPD\u2019s reasons, I find that it properly found that the Appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that an FIR had been registered against him or that there is a forward-facing risk. The RPD\u2019s reasons are based on the evidence in the record, namely the Appellant\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding the circumstances surrounding his wife receiving the FIR, the omission of subsequent police visits from his BOC narrative, the lack of further contact from Teymoor and the objective documentary evidence regarding FIRs. I agree with the RPD\u2019s findings that the Appellant failed to provide reasonable explanations for the discrepancies in the evidence. Aside from the RPD\u2019s reference to the Appellant\u2019s friend\u2019s affidavit not referring to his clothes being torn off, as discussed further below, I agree with the RPD that the discrepancies are significant and central to the core of the Appellant\u2019s claim. As pointed out by Appellant, the Federal Court has stated that it will not interfere with decisions where evidence, taken as a whole, supports its negative credibility assessment and where reasonable inferences are drawn from the evidence. I find that the RPD\u2019s determination that the Appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the FIR was issued against him or that there is a forward-facing risk is correct and based on the evidence in the record. The RPD did not ignore evidence The Appellant submits that the RPD ignored facts which add to the Appellant\u2019s overall credibility. The Appellant refers to Federal Court jurisprudence for the proposition that, when assessing credibility, all evidence, oral and documentary, must be considered, rather than just selected parts. While I agree that in assessing credibility, the decision maker cannot be selective in its consideration of the evidence, I reject the Appellant\u2019s submission that the RPD ignored facts which add to the Appellant\u2019s overall credibility. Aside from the Appellant\u2019s assertion that the RPD ignored facts which add to the Appellant\u2019s overall credibility, the Appellant does not specify the facts that were ignored. I find that, contrary to rule 3(3)(g) of the RAD Rules, the Appellant has not provided full and detailed submissions regarding this assertion. I have reviewed the RPD\u2019s reasons as part of my independent assessment and fail to see facts that were ignored by the RPD. Similarly, aside from setting out the proposition that all evidence must be considered in assessing one\u2019s credibility, rather than just selected parts, the Appellant does not specify how the RPD erred. I find that, contrary to rule 3(3)(g) of the RAD Rules, the Appellant has not provided full and detailed submissions regarding this assertion. I have reviewed the RPD\u2019s reasons as part of my independent assessment and find that the RPD properly considered all the evidence. As outlined above, the RPD considered the Appellant\u2019s BOC narrative and testimony. The RPD\u2019s reasons also include detailed assessments of the affidavits from Irfan Tahir Chachar and the Appellant\u2019s wife. The RPD notes that there are inconsistencies contained in the Appellant\u2019s testimony and his supporting documents, to which the RPD provided an opportunity to respond. The RPD properly considered the Appellant\u2019s explanations and explained why it found his explanations unreasonable. With respect to Irfan\u2019s affidavit, the RPD found that, as a result of its failure to refer to the Appellant hiding at Irfan\u2019s home for a month, the Appellant had not established, on a balance of probabilities, that he was in hiding. The RPD also notes that, contrary to the Appellant\u2019s account of his clothing being torn off in the incident, Irfan\u2019s affidavit does not refer to the Appellant\u2019s clothing being torn off and only mentions that he was injured. I agree with the Appellant\u2019s submissions that the RPD erred in relying on the affiant\u2019s omission of the Appellant\u2019s clothes having been torn off to undermine the weight that it assigned to the affidavit. I agree that this omission is not of sufficient significance to negatively impact the weight assigned to the affidavit. However, I find that the RPD was correct in assigning the affidavit little weight based on the affiant\u2019s failure to refer to the Appellant hiding at his home for over a month. I agree with the RPD that this relates to a core aspect of the claim, namely that the Appellant was in hiding after the September 18, 2016 incident. The RPD assigned Irfan\u2019s affidavit little weight based on an inconsistency regarding the Appellant\u2019s injuries contained in the affidavit and the Appellant\u2019s account of his injuries. The RPD properly considered the Appellant\u2019s explanation, which it found to be unreasonable, and noted that it relates to a core aspect of his claim, namely the violence the Appellant experienced at the hands of one of his agents of persecution. The RPD assigned the Appellant\u2019s wife\u2019s affidavit little weight based on discrepancies in the affidavit compared to the Appellant\u2019s testimony regarding when the Appellant stayed at Irfan\u2019s and the affiant\u2019s failure to mention that the wife received a copy of the FIR as alleged by the Appellant. The RPD properly considered the Appellant\u2019s explanation, which it found to be unreasonable, and noted that the Appellant\u2019s time in hiding and the issuance of the FIR are central to the heart of the claim, namely whether the Appellant is wanted for blasphemy and whether he remained in hiding. The RPD found that, considering this affidavit and the one from Irfan omit the Appellant being in hiding, the Appellant did not establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he remained in hiding for a month before leaving Pakistan. The RPD also considered the remaining documentation provided in support of the claim, including the Appellant\u2019s birth certificate, marriage certificate, and his family registration certificate, letters of support from his Shia temples in Pakistan, Canada and the US, photographs of him participating in various Shia events, a sale agreement for a plot of land and a Pakistan Federal Board of Revenue notice for building permits. The RPD noted that these documents do not include any information regarding the allegations of this claim or any mistreatment the Appellant endured in Pakistan, so assigned them no weight in establishing the core aspects of the claim. After reviewing the RPD\u2019s reasons, I find that it properly considered the totality of the evidence. Uncontested credibility findings The RPD made credibility findings that are not contested by the Appellant. These findings relate to inconsistencies in the Appellant\u2019s BOC narrative and testimony regarding when Teymoor first approached the Appellant regarding purchasing the property and the number of times that Teymoor visited the Appellant. As a result of these discrepancies, the RPD found that the alleged incidents with Teymoor and his friends did not occur as alleged. I also note that the RPD considered whether the mistreatment the Appellant suffered as a Shia Muslim would rise to a serious possibility of persecution and found that it did not. The Appellant does not contest these findings on appeal. After my independent assessment, I find that the RPD did not err in these findings. They are correct and based on the evidence in the record. CONCLUSION I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA.", "spans": "[{'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 2628, 'end': 2629}]", "label": "dismissed"}
{"doc_text": " Date: 20200122 Docket: IMM-6570-18 Citation: 2020 FC 93 Ottawa, Ontario, January 22, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Russell BETWEEN: IRFAN ALI SANA KHAN Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. INTRODUCTION [1] This is an application under s 72 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], for judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [RAD], dated December 3, 2018 [Decision], which dismissed the Applicants\u2019 appeal of the Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada\u2019s [RPD] decision denying the Applicants\u2019 refugee and person in need of protection claims under ss 96 and 97 of the IRPA. II. BACKGROUND [2] The Applicants, Irfan Ali and Sana Khan, are citizens of Pakistan. The couple married in 2013 and have three children together, all of whom were born in Canada. [3] Mr. Ali arrived in Canada in February 2009 as a Temporary Foreign Worker. He returned to Pakistan for six months in 2013 where he married Ms. Khan. The Applicants returned to Canada in 2014. [4] In October 2016, while planning to visit family in Pakistan, the Applicants learned of threats made against them by the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan [TTP]. In fact, Mr. Ali\u2019s father received two threatening calls from unknown persons warning that, unless money was paid, they would harm the father and the Applicants if the latter came to Pakistan. [5] A week later, at least a dozen armed men claiming to be members of the TTP showed up at the father\u2019s home near Mardan in the night and threatened to kill him and the Applicants if the latter were to return to Pakistan unless they paid $500,000. The TTP returned a few months later in February 2017 to deliver the same threats to Mr. Ali\u2019s father, prompting him to seek assistance from the jirga (council of elders) to mediate the conflict. The jirga was unsuccessful in convincing the TTP to pursue a mediated solution to the dispute. [6] Mr. Ali\u2019s testimony suggests that the TTP takes issue with the Applicants\u2019 ties to Canada, a country which the TTP believe has waged a war against Islam. The TTP considers the Applicants as enemies because their children were born in Canada and they have paid taxes in Canada, which the TTP sees as directly contributing to the war against Islam. [7] The Applicants subsequently cancelled their plans to visit Pakistan and filed refugee and person in need of protection claims on January 9, 2017. [8] Following a hearing on September 7, 2017, the RPD denied the Applicants\u2019 claims under ss 96 and 97 of the IRPA. Although the RPD determined that the Applicants were credible and accepted their allegations, it found that a viable internal flight alternative [IFA] existed within Pakistan in Hyderabad, Sindh. The RPD concluded there was \u201cinsufficient evidence [\u2026] that the TTP would be likely to know of the claimants\u2019 return to the country, would seek out the claimants in other cities or that the claimants have the profile of people likely to be tracked throughout the country.\u201d III. DECISION UNDER REVIEW [9] On December 3, 2018, the RAD dismissed the Applicants\u2019 appeal of the RPD\u2019s decision and found that the Applicants had a reasonable IFA in Hyderabad and therefore did not qualify as refugees or persons in need of protection under ss 96 and 97 of the IRPA. [10] Prior to analyzing whether a viable IFA existed, the RAD first considered whether the sixteen new items of evidence submitted by the Applicants were admissible pursuant to s 110(4) of the IRPA. This was determined using the first three factors set out in Raza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FCA 385, namely, credibility, relevance, and newness, which were later endorsed in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Singh, 2016 FCA 96 at para 64. [11] The RAD found that the sixteen new items of evidence, mostly news articles relating to Hyderabad and the TTP, were available prior to the RPD\u2019s decision. Nevertheless, the RAD decided to admit the new evidence pursuant to s 110(4) because the Applicants could not have anticipated the specific IFA location in advance of the RPD hearing, and this issue was clearly a central component of the appeal. [12] The RAD, however, refused to hold a new hearing based on this new evidence pursuant to s 110(6) of the IRPA as it believed the evidence did not raise a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the Applicants, nor was it determinative of the refugee protection claim. The RAD concluded that after reviewing the new articles, very few were relevant to the ability of the TTP to locate and target the Applicants in Hyderabad, as they largely referenced non-targeted attacks and events that took place in 2013 \u2013 2014 . The RAD found that the two articles directly related to targeted threats/attacks by the TTP in Hyderabad were not sufficiently persuasive to support the Applicants\u2019 position, since the TTP\u2019s actions in these instances targeted higher profile individuals such as a political candidate and a jail chief holding Taliban prisoners. [13] Moving on to the merits of the appeal, the RAD applied the two-prong test set out in Rasaratnam v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 FC 706, 140 NR 138 (FCA) [Rasaratnam] to assess the IFA proposed by the RPD. Having found that it is unlikely that the Applicants would be persecuted or personally subjected to a substantial risk of death or cruel and unusual punishment in Hyderabad, and it is reasonable, in all circumstances, for the Applicants to seek refuge in Hyderabad, the RAD rejected the Applicants\u2019 appeal finding that a reasonable IFA existed in Hyderabad. [14] Concerning the first prong of the Rasaratnam test, the RAD justified its finding that the Applicants did not face a risk of persecution or a personal risk in Hyderabad by citing: (1) the capacity and geographic reach of the TTP; (2) the Applicants\u2019 profile; and (3) the size of Hyderabad. [15] In fact, the RAD found that the evidence does not show that the TTP has the capacity to learn of the Applicants\u2019 return to Pakistan, their relocation to Hyderabad, or their whereabouts in Hyderabad. The RAD notes that the TTP does not operate as a unified and integral organization and has a limited history of activity in Hyderabad as compared to the region formally known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas [FATA] near the Applicants\u2019 hometown, which is some 1200 km away from Hyderabad. [16] Moreover, the RAD found that the TTP does not often undertake personal targeted attacks in Hyderabad and, when it does, these attacks primarily target high-profile persons and not persons with a profile similar to that of the Applicants. Given the fact that the Applicants are not politically active and the limited number of incidents in Hyderabad, the RAD found that the Applicants do not meet the profile of individuals historically targeted by the TTP, making it unlikely that the Applicants would be at personal risk from the TTP in Hyderabad. [17] The RAD also cited numerous reports from the Canadian, UK and Australian governments as well as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to support the finding that Hyderabad is a reasonable IFA for the Applicants. It noted that, along with the reasons stated above, Hyderabad is a \u201clarge urban centre\u201d that will provide the Applicants with a \u201cdegree of anonymity.\u201d [18] The RAD also explicitly noted that it had considered whether the relocation of the Applicants to Hyderabad would leave them unable to contact their family members in Pakistan for fear that the TTP would learn of their whereabouts. However, the RAD found that it would be \u201creasonable to expect that his family members would use a degree of discretion in any discussion about the claimants\u2019 location,\u201d and that Mr. Ali\u2019s father has not had contact with the TTP since February 2017. [19] As for the second prong of the Rasaratnam test, the RAD noted that, on a balance of probabilities, there are no serious social, economic, or other barriers to make the Applicants\u2019 relocation to Hyderabad unreasonable. The RAD came to this conclusion by applying the test to determine the reasonability of an IFA set out in Thirunavukkarasu v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] 1 FC 589, 163 NR 232 which, as the RAD notes, sets a very high threshold for what makes an IFA unreasonable. [20] In particular, the RAD concluded that the multiple languages spoken by the Applicants, their years of education, their work experience abroad, along with Mr. Ali\u2019s international travel experience and Ms. Khan\u2019s familiarity with the Sindh region, make their relocation to Hyderabad reasonable. IV. ISSUES [21] The issues to be determined in the present matter solely relate to whether the RAD\u2019s Decision concerning the existence of a viable IFA in Hyderabad was unreasonable. More specifically: Was it unreasonable for the RAD to conclude that the Applicants are unlikely to be personally targeted by the TTP in Hyderabad due to their profile? Was it unreasonable for the RAD to conclude that the TTP does not have the capacity and geographic reach to locate the Applicants in Hyderabad? Does the Decision unreasonably require the Applicants to go into hiding? Was it unreasonable for the RAD to conclude that the Applicants could relocate to Hyderabad? V. STANDARD OF REVIEW [22] This application was argued prior to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s recent decisions in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] and Bell Canada v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66. This Court\u2019s judgment was taken under reserve. The parties\u2019 submissions on the standard of review were therefore made under the Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir] framework. However, given the circumstances in this matter, and the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s instructions in Vavilov at para 144, this Court found that it was not necessary to ask the parties to make additional submissions on the standard of review. I have applied the Vavilov framework in my consideration of the application and it does not change the applicable standards of review in this case nor my conclusions. [23] In Vavilov, at paras 23-32, the majority sought to simplify how a court selects the standard of review applicable to the issues before it. The majority did away with the contextual and categorical approach taken in Dunsmuir in favour of instating a presumption that the reasonableness standard applies. However, the majority noted that this presumption can be set aside on the basis of (1) clear legislative intent to prescribe a different standard of review (Vavilov, at paras 33-52), and (2) certain scenarios where the rule of law requires the application of the standard of correctness, such as constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole and questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (Vavilov, at paras 53-64). [24] There was no disagreement between the parties that the applicable standard of review in this matter was the standard of reasonableness. [25] There is nothing to rebut the presumption that the standard of reasonableness applies in this case. The application of the standard of reasonableness to these issues is also consistent with the existing jurisprudence prior to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Vavilov. See, for example, Tagne v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 273 which summarized the state of the law prior to Vavilov on this matter noting at para 19 that: [19] It is well-established that a decision-maker\u2019s assessment of an IFA involves questions of mixed fact and law and is subject to review by this Court for reasonableness (Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 719 at paras 8-10; Figueroa v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 521 at para 13; Kamburona v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 1052 at para 18). As a result, the RAD\u2019s assessment of the availability of an IFA to the Applicant in Yaound\u00e9 attracts deference (Figueroa at para 13). In Tariq v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 1017 at paragraph 14, Justice Boswell explained the reason for the Court\u2019s deference: [14] [\u2026] Moreover, as the Court noted in Lebedeva v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 1165 at para 32, [2011] FCJ No 1439, determinations concerning an IFA \u201cwarrant deference because they involve not only the evaluation of the applicant\u2019s circumstances, as related by their testimony, but also an expert understanding of the country conditions involved.\u201d [26] When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with whether it \u201cbears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov, at para 99). Reasonableness is a single standard of review that varies and \u201ctakes its colour from the context\u201d (Vavilov, at para 89 citing Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para 59). These contextual constraints \u201cdictate the limits and contours of the space in which the decision maker may act and the types of solutions it may adopt\u201d (Vavilov, at para 90). Put in another way, the Court should intervene only when \u201cthere are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency\u201d (Vavilov, at para 100). The Supreme Court of Canada lists two types of fundamental flaws that make a decision unreasonable: (1) a failure of rationality internal to the decision-maker\u2019s reasoning process; and (2) untenability \u201cin light of the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it\u201d (Vavilov, at para 101). VI.

VII. ARGUMENT A. Applicants [28] The Applicants submit that the Decision is unreasonable because of: the RAD\u2019s speculative analysis of the Applicants\u2019 profile; the RAD\u2019s failure to consider critical information regarding the TTP\u2019s capacity and its presence in Hyderabad; the effect of the Decision which, for all intents and purposes, requires the Applicants to go into hiding; and the RAD\u2019s failure to consider the integration barriers and security risks the Applicants will face in Hyderabad. [29] Concerning the RAD\u2019s analysis of the Applicants\u2019 profile, the Applicants submit that the RAD failed to consider the fact that they have already attracted the attention of the TTP. The Applicants have been explicitly warned by the TTP, on numerous occasions, that they and their family will be harmed if they return to Pakistan. The RAD unreasonably chose to ignore this fact and conducted its own speculative analysis regarding the intent of the TTP. [30] The Applicants point out that there was no indication that the TTP had lost interest in targeting them, no indication that they did not intend to follow through with their threats, and no indication that they no longer believed that the Applicants support a \u201cwar against Islam.\u201d As such, it is unreasonable in these circumstances to conclude that the Applicants\u2019 profile is not one that would likely be targeted by the TTP if the Applicants return to Pakistan simply because the Applicants do not neatly fit into one of the profiles outlined in the national documentation package. [31] The Applicants rely on Qaddafi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 629 [Qaddafi] to support their argument that the RAD\u2019s analysis regarding the Applicants\u2019 profile was unreasonable. In Qaddafi, the Court found that it was unreasonable for the RAD to speculate that the applicant would no longer be targeted because he had ceased working for the UN. The threats received by the applicant in Qaddafi were clear, and there was no evidence to suggest that the agent of persecution did not intend to follow through on its threats because the applicant did not have a sufficient profile. In fact, the Court noted that the applicant \u201cobviously had a sufficient profile to provoke the threat\u201d (Qaddafi at para 76). [32] The Applicants also cite Mendoza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 715 where the Court summarizes a previous order rendered by Justice Kane which found that the assessment of the risk faced by the applicants in the proposed IFA was speculative. The Court found that it was unreasonable for the RPD to decide that the applicants were no longer active targets while at the same time accepting that they had been specifically targeted by the agent of persecution. In fact, the Court cites Justice Kane\u2019s finding at para 7 noting that: \u201cspeculation about how the Zetas [(the agent of persecution in that case)] would operate vis \u00e0 vis the applicants is illogical and unreasonable\u201d given the explicit threats made against them. [33] The Applicants also argue that the RAD did not rely on the most recent evidence at hand when determining that the TTP does not have the \u201coperational capacity or geographic reach\u201d to locate and target the Applicants in Hyderabad. In fact, the Applicants argue that the RAD ignored a critical article published by The Daily Beast, three years after the report relied upon, which documents the intent of the Taliban to unify in Pakistan and in Afghanistan. The Applicants argue that the RAD also erred in its consideration of an article regarding the killing of a political candidate in Hyderabad by the TTP, as well as another article detailing threats made by the TTP to a Hyderabad jail superintendent. The Applicants are not asking this Court to re-weigh the evidence; it is trite law that a decision-maker\u2019s failure to analyze critical evidence that contradicts its finding is unreasonable (Cepeda-Gutierrez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 157 FTR 35 at para 17, FCJ No 1425 [Cepeda-Gutierrez]). [34] Moreover, the Applicants argue that the Decision is unreasonable as it effectively forces the Applicants to hide their whereabouts from their own family to avoid alerting the TTP to their presence in Pakistan. The Applicants argue that this is because their family lives near the TTP and \u201ca reasonable inference can be made that the TTP could threaten the Applicants\u2019 family to reveal their location.\u201d The Applicants cite Zamora Huerta v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 586 [Zamora Huerta] in support of their position, a decision where this Court found that not being able to share one\u2019s whereabouts with family or friends is tantamount to requiring applicants to go into hiding and is therefore unreasonable. [35] Finally, the Applicants argue that their Pashto accents and their Canadian children, who speak English and have a Western accent, would prevent them from \u201cblending in\u201d while in Hyderabad, and would render them visible to the TTP. They also argue that the evidence in this case clearly establishes that the security situation in Hyderabad is unstable as there have been several suicide bombings and terrorist attacks. As such, they state that Hyderabad is not a reasonable IFA in this case. B. Respondent [36] The Respondent argues that the RAD\u2019s conclusions that there is an IFA in Hyderabad falls within the range of acceptable outcomes that were available following a thorough and proper analysis of the law and facts in this case. More specifically, the Respondent points to the \u201chigh onus\u201d on the Applicants to establish that the proposed IFA is unreasonable and argues that the Applicants\u2019 argument \u201cis merely an invitation to this Court to reweigh the evidence.\u201d [37] The Respondent cites this Court\u2019s decisions in Enhodor v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 1143 at para 10 and in Pidhorna v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1 at paras 39-42, and suggests that the latter provides an excellent overview of the state of the law on this point: [39] The test for an IFA is well established. There is a high onus on the applicant to demonstrate that a proposed IFA is unreasonable (Ranganathan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2001] 2 FC 164, [2000] FCJ No 2118 (FCA)). [40] The two part test for an IFA was established in Thirunavukkarasu v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] 1 FC 589, [1993] FCJ No 1172 (QL) (FCA) [Thirunavukkarasu]. The test is: (1) the Board must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the proposed IFA; and, (2) conditions in the proposed IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, upon consideration of all the circumstances, including consideration of a claimant\u2019s personal circumstances, for the claimant to seek refuge there. [41] As noted in Thirunavukkarasu: [14] An IFA cannot be speculative or theoretical only; it must be a realistic, attainable option. Essentially, this means that the alternative place of safety must be realistically accessible to the claimant. Any barriers to getting there should be reasonably surmountable. The claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there or in staying there. For example, claimants should not be required to cross battle lines where fighting is going on at great risk to their lives in order to reach a place of safety. Similarly, claimants should not be compelled to hide out in an isolated region of their country, like a cave in the mountains, or in a desert or a jungle, if those are the only areas of internal safety available. But neither is it enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there. If it is objectively reasonable in these latter cases to live in these places, without fear of persecution, then IFA exists and the claimant is not a refugee. [42] In Argote et al v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 128 at para 12, [2009] FCJ No 153 (QL), the Court noted that the onus is on an applicant to establish on objective evidence that the relocation to the IFA is unreasonable: [\u2026] Whether the relocation to the IFA is unreasonable is an objective test and the onus is on the applicants to establish on objective evidence that the relocation to the IFA is unreasonable. It is not for the Board to prove that it is reasonable, as the applicants suggest. [...] [38] In this case, the Respondent argues that the RAD, after considering all submissions and evidence, came to a reasonable conclusion that the Applicants had not established that the TTP in Mardan had the organizational capacity and geographic reach to learn of their relocation to Hyderabad and to target them there. [39] Moreover, the Respondent denies that the Decision requires the Applicants to hide their location from their family. The Respondent distinguishes this case from Zamora Huerta as Ms. Zamora had been targeted and located by an agent of the State rather than non-state actors, as is the case of the Applicants. [40] Finally, the Respondent argues that the Applicants are simply seeking a re-weighing of the evidence by this Court. The Respondent highlights that the Applicants\u2019 arguments primarily rely on the allocation of greater weight to certain newspaper articles as opposed to the contents of the national documentation package for Pakistan. The Respondent submits that the RAD has the discretion to assess and weigh the evidence on the record before coming to a decision, and that such a decision should not be disturbed if it is within the range of acceptable outcomes. The Respondent cites Petrova v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 506 at paras 55-56 in support of this principle. VIII. ANALYSIS [41] As regards the first prong of the IFA test set out by the Federal Court of Appeal in Rasaratnam, the heart of the RAD\u2019s Decision is as follows: [35] The RAD \ufb01nds the evidence does con\ufb01rm the risk to individuals, especially those of a high pro\ufb01le, during the time period of the articles. The RAD having reviewed all of the documentary evidence available \ufb01nds there is no persuasive evidence that the Taliban have conducted any operations associated with the targeting of individuals with a pro\ufb01le similar to the Appellants. [36] The RAD further \ufb01nds that this evidence does not indicate that the Taliban has targeted speci\ufb01c individuals with a pro\ufb01le such as the Appellants, nor does it con\ufb01rm that the Taliban has the willingness or ability to search for the Appellants outside of their village in the Mardan region of KPK province. [37] The RAD has reviewed the submissions of the Appellants, the available documentary evidence, and \ufb01nds that as much as the principal Appellant\u2019s father may have been targeted by individuals in his home village who are members of the TTP, there is not suf\ufb01cient credible evidence to establish that they have the operational capacity or geographic reach to learn of the Appellants\u2019 return to Pakistan upon arrival at a regular port of entry to the country, or trace the Appellants\u2019 movements within Pakistan. [38] The RAD has previously discussed that the documentary evidence does not support that the TTP has that ability in Pakistan. The RAD agrees with the \ufb01ndings of the RPD in this instance. As such, the RAD \ufb01nds the problem faced by the Appellants is limited and local in nature. The RAD \ufb01nds the Appellants\u2019 argument must fail. [42] The RAD relies, inter alia, upon the UK Home Office report which specifically says that \u201cordinary Pakistanis, including students and those perceived to be opposing the Taliban and other militant groups or not following Sharia law, have also been subject to violence by these groups\u201d (emphasis added). The evidence is therefore clear that those in need of protection do not have to belong to a \u201cprimary target\u201d group. [43] The Applicants have clearly established that they have been targeted and threatened by the TTP. The RAD says that Mr. Ali\u2019s father has been targeted in his home village but, in fact, it is the Applicants who are the primary target and the father is little more than a conduit at the moment, although he would be harmed if the TTP learn of the Applicants\u2019 return. The evidence is clear that the Applicants have already been targeted and threatened with death if they return to Pakistan. The fact that they do not fit some primary target profile is irrelevant. [44] Consequently, the Decision must stand or fall on the RAD\u2019s conclusion that the evidence does not confirm that \u201cthe Taliban has the willingness or ability to search for the Appellants outside of their village in the Mardan region of KPK province\u201d and its finding that: there is not sufficient credible evidence to establish that [the Taliban] have the operational capacity or geographic reach to learn of the Appellants\u2019 return to Pakistan upon arrival at a regular port of entry to the country, or trace the Appellants\u2019 movements within Pakistan. [45] The issue of whether the TTP has the \u201cwillingness\u201d to search for the Applicants beyond the Mardan region is somewhat tied to the RAD\u2019s mishandling of the Applicants\u2019 profile. The TTP has shown that they are more than willing to threaten the Applicants in Canada and warn them that they face death if they return to any location in Pakistan. The RAD does not question the evidence that the Applicants now have a political/religious aspect to their profile and that the TTP are of the view that they are supporting a western power in a war against Islam. [46] The issue is not whether the TTP will learn of the Applicants\u2019 return to Pakistan \u201cupon arrival at a regular port of entry [\u2026].\u201d Rather, the issue is whether the TTP is likely to learn of the Applicants\u2019 return to Pakistan and their presence in Hyderabad and whether the TTP has either the willingness or the wherewithal to seek them out in that large city to cause them harm. [47] On this crucial issue, the RAD summarizes its view of the evidence and finds as follows at para 25: \u25cf The evidence before the RPD and the RAD establishes the TTP in Pakistan does not operate as a uni\ufb01ed, integrated organization that operates within a solitary hierarchical structure; \u25cf The limited documentary evidence that indicates the TTP have been active in Hyderabad; \u25cf The evidence that the Taliban has carried out attacks against state actors and members of religious minorities or others it perceives to be in opposition to its goals, which have taken place mainly in the region previously known as the FATA, close to the Appellants\u2019 home in Peshawar region, and in other regions distant from the proposed IFA locations; \u25cf The proposed IFA in Hyderabad (a city of over 3 million people), quali\ufb01es as a \u201clarge urban center\u201d that would provide a \u201cdegree of anonymity\u201d as stated in the U.K. Home Office document; and \u25cf That considering the geographic size of Pakistan, the large number of ports of entry to the country, and the vast population of Hyderabad, it would take a signi\ufb01cantly coordinated, networked and organized entity to target the Appellants in Hyderabad. The documentary evidence does not support the notion that the TTP has that organizational ability. [footnotes omitted.] [48] An obvious concern for the Applicants is that the TTP will learn that they are in Hyderabad through their family members. The RAD deals with this concern as follows at para 26: The RAD has considered the Appellants\u2019 argument that the Appellants would be unable to contact their family members should they return to Pakistan. The RAD notes that the Appellants clearly testi\ufb01ed that when the Appellants initially planned to return to their village in Pakistan, that the principal Appellant\u2019s father told everyone in town about their return. He further stated, \u201cThey have arranged for the celebration that there would be songs and celebrations because is the \ufb01rst time my grandchildren are coming and there will be celebrations, he told everyone\u201d. The RAD \ufb01nds that it would be reasonable to expect that his family members would use a degree of discretion in any discussion about the Appellants\u2019 location. The RAD further notes that the principal Appellant testi\ufb01ed that the last contact his father had with individuals from the TTP in his village was in February 2017. No additional evidence has been adduced to indicate that the local TTP have an ongoing interest in the Appellants. [49] The finding here is that Mr. Ali\u2019s father and other family members are unlikely to tell anyone that the Applicants have taken up residence in Hyderabad. This raises the issue of how family members will deal with a direct inquiry from the TTP as to the Applicants\u2019 whereabouts. In my view, it would not be reasonable to expect family members to place their own lives in danger by either denying knowledge of the Applicants\u2019 whereabouts or deliberately misleading the TTP. The RAD\u2019s principal point on this issue is that \u201c[n]o evidence has been adduced to indicate that the local TTP have an ongoing interest in the Appellants.\u201d Indeed, the burden of proof is upon the Applicants to demonstrate on a balance of probabilities that, in accordance with Rasaratnam, there is a serious possibility that the Applicants would be persecuted by the TTP in Hyderabad. However, there is no evidence at all that the TTP has lost interest in the Applicants and no longer intends to harm them should the opportunity arise. The TTP has made it clear that the Applicants will be killed if they return to Pakistan. [50] Given the dangers posed by knowledge of their whereabouts, or even their return to Pakistan, the Applicants would be forced to hide from family members and friends and cut off communications. This is not a reasonable requirement and so cannot be used to obviate risk under the first prong. This Court noted in Zamora Huerta at para 29 that: Not to be able to share your whereabouts with family or friends is tantamount to requiring the Applicant to go into hiding. It is also an implicit recognition that even in these large cities, the Applicant is not beyond her common-law spouse\u2019s reach. In these particular circumstances, this cannot constitute an IFA for the Applicant. The Board\u2019s finding of an IFA does not fall within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law in the circumstances. As a result, the decision with respect to an IFA is unreasonable and must be set aside. [51] It also has to be born in mind that the Applicants have lived and worked in Canada since 2009 and they have Canadian children who cannot be kept in hiding in Hyderabad. The Applicants therefore cannot be characterized as ordinary Pakistanis. Their links with Canada are bound to become known, at least locally. [52] Given that the TTP is fully aware that the Applicants are in Canada, it is no surprise that the TTP has not again approached family members in Pakistan to discover their whereabouts since 2017. There is no basis to conclude that the TTP has lost interest in the Applicants or that they are not likely to approach the family again for further information on their whereabouts. To require new evidence on this point that post-dates the 2017 visit is to lose sight of the grounds for the TTP\u2019s threats against the Applicants and what the TTP now knows about their whereabouts. The Applicants have been warned by the TTP not to return to Pakistan \u2013 not just their home district. The evidence is clear that the TTP view the Applicants as enemies because they reside in Canada, have Canadian-born children, and have been paying taxes in Canada. Mr. Ali\u2019s testimony that the TTP regards them as Canadians who have supported a war against Islam was accepted. It is unreasonable for the RAD to suggest that there is no evidence to support that \u201cthe local TTP have an ongoing interest in the Appellants.\u201d [53] When these factors are taken into account, the remaining basis for the Decision is that \u201cthere is not sufficient credible evidence that [the TTP] ha[s] the operational capacity or geographical reach to learn of the Appellants\u2019 return to Pakistan upon arrival at a regular port of entry to the country, or trace the Appellants\u2019 movements within Pakistan,\u201d and that \u201cthere is little persuasive evidence to support [\u2026] that the TTP (the agent of persecution) ha[s] an active presence in Hyderabad or that they have interest or the ability to find the Appellants in the IFA location.\u201d The RPD concluded as follows and this appears to have been endorsed by the RAD: Overall, the claimants\u2019 pro\ufb01le is not among the groups likely to be targeted throughout the country. The Taliban is splintered and different groups control different areas. It is unlikely that the group that controls Mardan would be aware of the claimant\u2019s [sic] return to Pakistan, would track his whereabouts throughout the country, would coordinate with other Taliban related groups, or with members in Hyderabad, or follow through on an attack in an area such as Hyderabad where they do not exert control and where there is insuf\ufb01cient evidence of likely terrorist attacks and violence. Based on all of this, there is no serious possibility of persecution or a likely risk of harm to the claimants in Hyderabad. [54] As I have already pointed out, the issue is whether the TTP has the wherewithal to discover that the Applicants are living in Hyderabad. If the Applicants return to Hyderabad, the TTP could discover their whereabouts in the same way they discovered the Applicants were living in Canada. [55] The Applicants have now been identified by the TTP as enemies of Islam who have assisted a foreign power. They have also been specifically told that if they return to Pakistan they will be killed. Given the specificity of this threat, there is no evidence to support a conclusion that the TTP is unlikely to target the Applicants if they return to Pakistan. The RAD is speculating. There is no evidence before the RAD that the TTP has lost interest in the Applicants or that they have no intention of following through on their threats if the Applicants return to Pakistan. Instead, the Applicants\u2019 profile as described, e.g. supporters of the war against Islam, was sufficient for the TTP to target them in the first place, and it has not changed. [56] The RAD\u2019s conclusions that the TTP would not have the operational capacity or geographic reach to find or pursue the Applicants in Hyderabad because it does not operate as a unified, integrated organization with a solitary hierarchical structure, fails to take into account evidence that conflicts with such a conclusion. See Cepeda-Gutierrez at paras 14-17. An article in The Daily Beast titled \u201cThe Blood-Drenched Return of Pakistan\u2019s Taliban,\u201d published three years after the 2014 Response to Information Request relied upon by the RAD, reports as follows: Muhammad Khorasni, a spokesman for the TTP militants, sent an email last week announcing that all the fractured Taliban groups are coming together and have appointed a new deputy head of the organization, uniting what had been separate factions. Another TTP source told The Daily Beast that the organization was dispersed after government offensives that began in 2014, but their ideology and commitment remained and they were able to rebuild. \u201cYour Western media forecasted that the Taliban regime in Afghanistan collapse, but the Taliban regrouped and reorganized. That is exactly what the TTP has been doing since the Pakistan army operations. It bounced back, reorganized, and will take revenge.\u201d \u201cTTP leaders had a meeting on Jan. 20 near the Af/Pak border,\u201d this source claimed. \u201cAll the groups agreed in principle to combine attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\u201d [57] Read together, the evidence shows the evolution of the TTP from 2014 to 2017. There is a clear difference between the state of the TTP in 2014 and in 2017. The report relied on by the RAD explicitly mentions that the TTP is fractious, is facing its biggest schism yet, and not a unified fighting force. Meanwhile, The Daily Beast article also describes a dispersed TTP in 2014 (consistent with the report relied on by the RAD) but goes on to detail the TTP\u2019s efforts to rebuild in the following years, their increasing activity outside their traditional region, and the unification of TTP factions under common leadership. This evidence was ignored by the RAD. [58] The RAD was, at least, obliged to consider and mention this evidence and provide reasons for discounting it in its conclusions on the operational reach and capacity of the TTP in Pakistan. In addition, the RAD\u2019s mistakes about the Applicants\u2019 profile cannot be separated from the issue of the TTP\u2019s motivation to pursue the Applicants. They are not ordinary people who have not been targeted and who are unlikely to be targeted. They have already been targeted in a specific way and have been identified as enemies of Islam who should be killed. This necessarily results in an increase in the TTP\u2019s motivation to pursue them and cause them harm. The RAD does not address this factor in its Decision because it concludes, mistakenly, that the Applicants are in the same position as ordinary Pakistanis who have no profile with the TTP. [59] The Respondent says that the RAD did not consider reports that predated The Daily Beast article. However, the specific Response to Information Request contained in the national document package which the RAD relied upon for the finding that the TTP does not operate as a unified, integrated organization was prepared in July 2014. The Daily Beast article should have alerted the RAD to the issue of whether the information on lack of unification and integration relied upon was still valid. After all, the safety of the Applicants depends upon it being so. There was clear evidence before the RAD to suggest that conditions had changed and that its conclusions about the TTP\u2019s reach were dated and inaccurate. No mention is made of The Daily Beast article. It did not have to be accepted, but it had to be dealt with and weighed against the other information about the TTP\u2019s reach in Pakistan. This is not a weighing issue. Rather, the RAD appears to have ignored evidence that contradicts its own conclusions. In accordance with the principles set out in Cepeda-Gutierrez, at paras 14-17, this was a reviewable error that requires this matter to be returned for reconsideration. [60] My conclusion is that the RAD has not reasonably addressed the first prong of the Rasaratnam test in this case. Accordingly, there is no point in addressing the second prong of that test. This matter needs to be reconsidered by a differently constituted RAD. [61] Counsel agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs. JUDGMENT IN IMM-6570-18 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that The application is granted and the Decision is quashed. The matter shall be returned for reconsideration by a differently constituted RAD.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200116 Docket: IMM-589-19 Citation: 2020 FC 58 Ottawa, Ontario, January 16, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Justice Elliott BETWEEN: ZINA HAMID NAMAN Applicant and THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Respondent JUDGMENT and REASONS I. Nature of the Application [1] This is an application for judicial review. The Applicant, who is self-represented, seeks to set aside a decision made on January 3, 2019 by a member of the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [IRB] that dismissed the Applicant\u2019s application to re-open her appeal of a departure order made against her [the Decision]. [2] For the reasons that follow, this application is dismissed. II. Background Facts A. The Departure Order [3] The departure order was made against the Applicant on June 30, 2014 when she returned to Canada from Iraq via Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport. At that time, the Applicant was a permanent resident of Canada and a citizen of Iraq. [4] The Applicant was found to be inadmissible to Canada because she had failed to comply with the residency obligations set out in section 28 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. Paragraph 41(b) of the IRPA provides that failing to comply with section 28 makes a permanent resident inadmissible to Canada. B. The Appeal of the Departure Order [5] Two weeks later, on July 10, 2014, the Applicant filed a Notice of Appeal against the departure order. [6] By letter dated July 31, 2014, the IAD acknowledged receipt of the notice of appeal and provided an outline of the process that would ensue. It also enclosed a Notice of Change of Contact Information form and advised the Applicant that she had to notify the IAD of any change to her contact information including her address, telephone number, fax number and any email address. [7] The letter concluded by advising the Applicant that once the appeal record was received from Respondent\u2019s counsel, the IAD would contact the Applicant about the next step to be taken. It referred to fixing a date for the appeal hearing as a possible step. In a footnote marked \u201cIMPORTANT\u201d (emphasis in the original), the letter said that if the Applicant failed to appear for a hearing the IAD may determine under subsection 168(1) of the IRPA that she had abandoned her appeal. [8] A few months later, on September 10, 2014, a Notification of Client Contact Information form was submitted to the IRB on behalf of the Applicant. The form contained a new address and telephone number for the Applicant, as well as a fax number. C. The Notice to Appear at a Scheduling Conference [9] On July 17, 2017, a Notice to Appear at a Scheduling Conference [Notice to Appear] to be held by teleconference on September 13, 2017 was sent by regular mail to the Applicant. [10] Enclosed with that notice was another Notice of Change of Contact Information form. The letter contained the same warning footnote describing the consequences of failing to appear at the hearing as was contained in the July 31, 2014 letter. [11] The Notice to Appear was sent to the address provided on behalf of the Applicant on September 10, 2014. In addition, it indicated that the IAD would contact the Applicant at the telephone number she had provided. D. The Applicant fails to attend the Scheduling Conference [12] The Applicant did not attend the scheduling teleconference on September 13, 2017. She states that she did not receive the Notice to Appear. It transpired that she had moved and failed to advise the IAD of her new address. [13] On the scheduled teleconference date, the IAD reached a person at the telephone number that the Applicant had provided on September 10, 2014. The person identified themselves as part of the Iraqi Canadian Group Organization that filled out the appeal form for the Applicant. The person indicated that they had not heard from the Applicant and that the last address they had for her was from 2014. E. The Appeal is declared Abandoned and the Applicant applies for Citizenship [14] On September 25, 2017, the IAD declared that the Applicant had abandoned her appeal. To do so it relied upon subsection 168(1) of the IRPA, which indicates that a failure to appear for a hearing is one of the grounds upon which a proceeding may be declared, abandoned. The IAD also considered that no mail had been returned and the Notice to Appear had been sent to the Applicant at her stated address. In addition, she could not be reached by telephone at the contact number she had provided. [15] The notes from the scheduling conference indicate that no mail had been returned to the IAD and that there were no entries after 2015. The notes state that the Applicant had a valid Permanent Residence card as well as a visa, which she had not used. The notes also indicate that the Applicant\u2019s children are in Canada but the father has full custody. The Respondent\u2019s counsel before the IAD requested that the Applicant\u2019s appeal be declared abandoned. [16] The Applicant applied for citizenship on December 1, 2017. Her application was rejected because there was a departure order in place. The Applicant says that at that time, she was not aware that the departure order was still outstanding. She says she was also unaware of the decision by the IAD that she had abandoned her appeal of the departure order. F. The Applicant submits another Appeal [17] On August 13, 2018, the Applicant filed another Notice of Appeal of her departure order. The IAD responded by advising her that there was no new departure order, there was only the June 30, 2014 order. As a result, the Applicant abandoned her August 13, 2018 appeal and replaced it with an application to re-open her original appeal. [18] On October 9, 2018, the Applicant wrote to the IRB pointing out that she had not heard anything since the departure order letter that had been sent two years and 10 months previously. She stated that she had left Canada twice in 2017, and on her return, each time, she was not denied re-entry. The Applicant claimed that it was only after she applied for citizenship that she learned of the departure order. III. The Decision [19] The decision under review is the refusal to re-open the Applicant\u2019s appeal. [20] In the Decision, the IAD reviewed the background facts and submissions contained in an affidavit filed by the Applicant. It then noted information and submissions put forward by a hearings advisor from the Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA]. Those submissions referred to subsection 13(4) of the Immigration Appeal Division Rules, SOR/2002-230. The subsection requires that, without delay, a person provide in writing to the IAD and to the Respondent any change to their contact information. [21] The CBSA also referred to subsection 168(1) of the IRPA, noting that it was referred to on the Notice of Appeal form which also contained a warning that her appeal could be abandoned if she failed to appear or provide up-to-date contact information. [22] The CBSA pointed out that the passage of time since filing an appeal does not affect the enforceability of a removal order. It submitted that the Applicant did not demonstrate that when the IAD made the decision declaring her appeal abandoned it had failed to observe a principle of natural justice as required by section 71 of the IRPA. [23] The Applicant provided reply submissions reiterating the lengthy passage of time since the issuance of the removal order and her ability to leave and re-enter Canada twice without incident. [24] The IAD found the Applicant lacked credibility because she had paid the Citizenship application fee in May 2017, well before she first returned to Canada in September 2017. [25] In addition, on her Citizenship application, the Applicant did not truthfully answer whether she was or had ever been under a removal order. The IAD pointed out that in the section above her signature, the Applicant was warned that if she made a false representation or concealed any material circumstances relevant to her application, she could be charged with an offence and could be prohibited from becoming a citizen for five years. [26] The IAD found that the Applicant was aware that a removal order had been issued against her but she still provided a false response in her citizenship application. The panel made a negative credibility finding that the Applicant was trying to circumvent contesting the departure order on its merits. [27] Finding that there had been no failure by the IAD to observe a principle of natural justice, the IAD dismissed the Applicant\u2019s application to reopen her appeal. IV. Issue and Standard of Review [28] The only issue in this matter is whether the Decision was reasonable. [29] This application was argued shortly before the Supreme Court of Canada released the decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] in which it restated how a reviewing court is to conduct a reasonableness review. [30] Vavilov has done away with the former requirement that, in instances where the standard of review had not already been satisfactorily determined, an analysis of the appropriate standard is to be conducted by the Court. Instead, there is now a clear statement that when the merits of an administrative decision are judicially reviewed, the applicable standard of review is presumed to be reasonableness: Vavilov at para 23. [31] The presumption does not apply to an issue involving a breach of natural justice or the duty of procedural fairness: Vavilov at para 23. Nor does it apply if the legislature explicitly states that a different standard of review is to be applied to a particular administrative body, or if it provides for a statutory appeal of an administrative decision maker to a court: Vavilov at para 33. [32] The presumption is also displaced where the rule of law requires correctness review. This includes constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies: Vavilov at para 53. [33] None of the circumstances rebutting or displacing the presumption of reasonableness review apply here. Therefore, the standard of review is reasonableness. [34] This application was argued on the basis that the standard of review is reasonableness. Although the principles set out in Vavilov now apply to this application, I find that it is not necessary to receive further submissions from the parties as the result would be the same under the pre-Vavilov framework established in Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir] and its progeny. [35] Vavilov has not changed the focus of previous jurisprudence such as Dunsmuir. The well-known administrative law requirement that the reasons demonstrate that a decision is transparent, intelligible and justified remains alive and well: Vavilov at para 15. Rather, Vavilov has sharpened the focus by confirming that both the reasoning process and the outcome of a decision are to be considered in assessing whether a decision is reasonable: Vavilov at para 86. [36] As set out in the following analysis, I find that the Decision adheres to the Vavilov requirement that \u201ca reasonable decision is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker.\u201d When that requirement is met, a reviewing court is required to defer to the decision: Vavilov at para 85. V. Analysis A. The Applicant failed to keep her contact information current [37] The Applicant relies heavily on the fact that she never received the Notice to Appear. There is no dispute as to that fact. [38] The problem is that the Applicant was the author of her own misfortune. The Applicant was fully aware of the obligation to keep her contact information current. She had previously completed and submitted to the IRB the Notice of Change of Contact Information form. At that time, she supplied new contact information for her address and telephone number. Having done so, she is taken to have been aware of the warnings on the form stating that: - she must keep her contact information up-to-date; and, - if she failed to appear for a scheduled hearing she could be found to have abandoned her appeal. [39] The Notice of Appeal filed by the Applicant on July 25, 2014, contained the same information. It was located almost directly above the Applicant\u2019s signature. It is very noticeable. The text is prefaced by the word \u201cimportant\u201d set out in all uppercase letters, bold typeface and underlined, as follows: IMPORTANT. Yet, the Applicant never updated her contact information after the initial form was provided on September 10, 2014. [40] The Respondent provided to the IAD a copy of the application for citizenship filed by the Applicant on December 1, 2017. In that application, she declared that she had lived at her current address in Windsor since January 2016. That address is not the same as the one she provided to the IAD in 2014. [41] For the foregoing reasons, there is no merit to the Applicant\u2019s suggestion that failure to receive the Notice to Appear is the fault of the IRB. The IRB properly sent the Notice to Appear to the most current address for the Applicant that was on file. B. The Applicant has not shown that section 71 of the IRPA was met [42] In declaring the appeal abandoned, the IAD relied upon section 71 of the IRPA, which provides that the IAD may reopen an appeal made by a foreign national who has not left Canada if it is satisfied that the IAD failed to observe a principle of natural justice. [43] Section 71 is of narrow application. When Parliament enacted the section, it extinguished the IAD\u2019s \u201cequitable jurisdiction\u201d to reopen an appeal, except where the IAD has failed to observe a principle of natural justice: Nazifpour v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FCA 35 at paras 78-80 and 83. [44] The breach of natural justice must be the fault of the IAD and must not be caused by an applicant\u2019s wilful choice: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Ishmael, 2007 FC 212 at paras 24-25. [45] It is a basic principle of natural justice that an applicant has the right to know the case to be met and is to be provided with an opportunity to be heard. It is also basic that the procedure followed by the decision-maker must treat an applicant fairly. Receiving notice of a hearing that may result in serious consequences to an applicant is part and parcel of fair treatment, going hand in hand with the right to be heard. [46] The Applicant knew the case to be met when she received the scheduling conference correspondence and when she filed the appeal. She was given the opportunity to participate, but as a result of her own misadventure in not updating her contact information, she failed to capitalize on that opportunity. If she had kept the person who helped her complete her forms apprised of her new contact information, there is a chance she would have been able to participate, as that person could have contacted her when they received the call from the IRB. [47] The Applicant raised no argument before the IAD that the original IAD decision declaring her appeal to be abandoned violated a principle of natural justice. She argued that the passage of time without hearing anything further as to her deportation order misled her when she twice was able to re-enter Canada after being abroad. However, that argument is without merit. The IAD reviewed her citizenship application and noted that she paid the application fee on May 3, 2017, which was before she left Canada on July 1, 2017. Being allowed back into Canada on September 3, 2017 therefore could not have misled her to believe she could apply for citizenship, as she claimed. VI. Conclusion [48] The Applicant was clearly advised more than once, in writing, that she was required to keep her contact information up-to-date. By not doing so, she must accept the consequences. [49] There is no allegation that the Decision was arrived at in a manner that was procedurally unfair to the Applicant or that violated the principles of natural justice. Nor is there any such evidence in the Certified Tribunal Record. The procedures set out in the IRPA and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 were followed by the officials in question. There is simply no basis upon which to set the Decision aside. [50] The Decision is reasonable. It is internally coherent and there is a rational chain of analysis. The outcome is justified in relation to the facts, which are supported by the underlying record and the law, which was clearly identified and applied by the IAD. The reasons provided by the IAD permit the Applicant and this Court to understand both how and why the Decision was made. [51] The application is dismissed, without costs. [52] There is no serious question of general importance for certification on these facts. JUDGMENT in IMM-589-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The Application is dismissed, without costs.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200120 Docket: IMM-2900-19 Citation: 2020 FC 75 Toronto, Ontario, January 20, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Fothergill BETWEEN: LILING ZHANG JIANNING ZHANG JIA YI ZHANG ZHANG JIA HOA ZHANG JIA LIN ZHANG Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] Liling and Jianning Zhang are a married couple. They are citizens of China. They have three minor children. Jia Yi and Jia Hoa are citizens of Venezuela, where they were born. Jia Lin is a citizen of Hong Kong, where he was born. Liling and Jianning Zhang are former permanent residents of Venezuela. [2] The Zhangs seek judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB]. The RAD confirmed a decision of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the IRB, which found that the Zhangs are neither refugees nor persons in need of protection pursuant to ss 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. [3] The basis upon which the RAD dismissed the Zhangs\u2019 refugee claims differed from that of the RPD. The RAD held that, at the time their refugee claims were heard, the Zhangs held a status in Venezuela that was substantially similar to nationals of that country. The RAD found they had voluntarily relinquished this status, and were therefore excluded from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1E of the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, July 28, 1951, 189 UNTS 150 [Convention] and s 98 of the IRPA. [4] At the hearing of this application for judicial review, counsel for the Zhangs confirmed that no claim for protection is being advanced on behalf of the minor child, Jia Lin, who is a citizen of Hong Kong. [5] For the reasons that follow, I am not persuaded that the RAD applied the wrong standard of review to its analysis of the RPD\u2019s decision. The RAD\u2019s assessment of the Zhangs\u2019 credibility and its determination that Liling and Jianning were excluded from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention were both reasonable. The application for judicial review is dismissed. II. Background [6] Liling Zhang was born in Guangdong Province in 1976. She says she left for Venezuela in 1999 because of China\u2019s \u201cone-child\u201d policy. [7] Liling and Jianning met in Venezuela, and their two eldest children were born there in 2002 and 2004. In 2007, the children were sent to live with Liling\u2019s parents in China due to the deteriorating political situation in Venezuela. China does not recognize dual citizenship, and the two eldest children hold only Venezuelan citizenship. The youngest child was born in Hong Kong in 2008. [8] The Zhangs say that Jianning was the victim of several kidnapping attempts in Venezuela, at least one of which was successful. Liling says that the store she ran was robbed repeatedly. She testified about high crime and violence against Chinese immigrants in Venezuela, beginning in 2006. [9] The Zhangs provided no documents to support their assertions of kidnappings or robberies, nor to show they were victims of violence because they were Chinese immigrants. None of the crimes allegedly committed against them were reported to the authorities. [10] The Zhangs say they considered returning to China, but feared persecution due to the \u201cone-child\u201d policy and their practice of Christianity. They provided no documents to support either risk of harm. The RPD noted that the Zhangs had returned to China many times after 2011, and concluded they could freely practice their faith in China together with millions of other Chinese Christians. [11] The Zhangs entered Canada on August 5, 2013, as tourists with visitor\u2019s visas. After spending five months in this country, they decided to stay. They continued to travel between Hong Kong, China, Canada and Venezuela. They did not initiate a claim for refugee protection until January 10, 2015. [12] Jianning did not return to Venezuela after March 2014. Liling returned to Venezuela in May 2014 to renew Jia Hoa\u2019s Venezuelan National Identity Card. Liling returned to China in 2016 with Jia Yi and Jia Hoa, and again left them in the care of her parents. A. The RPD\u2019s Decision [13] The hearing before the RPD began on March 5, 2015, but was adjourned when the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [Minister] intervened and recommended exclusion under Article 1E of the Convention. The hearing did not resume until April 23, 2018. [14] On June 5, 2018, the RPD declined to exclude the Zhangs from refugee protection pursuant to Article 1E of the Convention. By this time, they had lost their permanent resident status in Venezuela because they had remained outside that country for two continuous years. Their right to return to Venezuela lapsed in 2016. [15] The RPD nevertheless found that the Zhangs had failed to demonstrate they would be subject to persecution in China, Venezuela or Hong Kong. There was insufficient evidence that they would be persecuted in China due to their practice of Christianity, and Guangdong Province relaxed its \u201cone-child\u201d policy in 2016. [16] The RPD also found that the Zhangs had failed to rebut the presumption that the Venezuelan authorities would protect Jia Yi and Jia Hoa as citizens of that country. No risk of harm was advanced on behalf of Jia Lin in relation to Hong Kong. B. The RAD\u2019s Decision [17] The sole issued raised by the Zhangs before the RAD was the manner in which the RPD assessed the evidence and rejected their credibility. However, the RAD informed the Zhangs that it intended to revisit the question of their exclusion from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention. They were given an opportunity to make further submissions, which they did. [18] The RAD concluded that the RPD had improperly assessed the Zhangs\u2019 status in Venezuela as of April 23, 2018. The RAD found they still had permanent resident status in Venezuela when the RPD hearing began on March 5, 2015, and allowed it to lapse voluntarily. [19] The RAD applied the analytical framework established by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Zeng, 2010 FCA 118 [Zeng] at paragraph 28: Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts. [20] The RAD concluded that the Zhangs were permanent residents of Venezuela when the hearing before the RPD began, and were at that time excluded from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention. The RAD did not accept the Zhangs\u2019 explanation for their failure to renew their Venezuelan permanent residence, namely that they believed it was unsafe to return to Venezuela. [21] The RAD considered country conditions in Venezuela, and concluded that the Zhangs could have returned to Venezuela to renew their status between the beginning and end of the RPD hearing. The RAD rejected the Zhangs\u2019 allegations of persecution in Venezuela, and held they had voluntarily relinquished their status in that country. Liling and Jianning were therefore excluded from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention. There was no probative evidence that the Venezuelan-born children could not return there, or that the youngest child would be at risk in Hong Kong. III. Issues [22] This application for judicial review raises the following issues: Did the RAD apply the wrong standard of review? Did the RAD unreasonably exclude the Zhangs from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention? Did the RAD unreasonably reject the Zhangs\u2019 credibility? A. Did the RAD apply the wrong standard of review? [23] Counsel for the Zhangs did not address the argument respecting standard of review in oral submissions before the Court, and indicated he would rely on his written representations. [24] The RAD is required to review findings of fact (and mixed fact and law) against the standard of correctness when they do not involve questions of the credibility of oral evidence. After carefully considering the RPD\u2019s decision, the RAD must conduct its own analysis of the record to determine whether the RPD erred. Having done this, the RAD must provide a final determination, by either confirming the RPD\u2019s decision or setting it aside and substituting its own determination of the merits of the refugee claim. It is only when the RAD is of the opinion that it cannot provide such a final determination without hearing the oral evidence presented to the RPD that the matter can be returned to the RPD for redetermination (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93 [Huruglica] at para 103). [25] The Zhangs take issue with the RAD\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]n assessing issues involving credibility of oral testimony, I have applied the RAD modified standard of reasonableness in those situations where the RPD enjoys a meaningful advantage in making a particular finding\u201d. The Zhangs say there is nothing to indicate that the RAD reviewed the transcript or audio recording of the hearing, and it therefore failed to assess the evidence independently. [26] I am not persuaded that the RAD applied the wrong standard of review. The RAD excluded the Zhangs from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention, and credibility assessments were less central to its analysis. Furthermore, the RAD repeatedly stated that its conclusions were based on an independent assessment of the evidence. The Zhangs have identified nothing in the RAD\u2019s decision that demonstrates it applied the wrong standard of review. Nor have they established that a more independent assessment of the evidence would have affected the result. The RAD provided transparent and intelligible reasons for confirming or rejecting the RPD\u2019s assessment of the Zhangs\u2019 credibility and other matters it was required to consider. B. Did the RAD unreasonably exclude the Zhangs from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention? [27] The RAD\u2019s findings of fact and credibility assessments are subject to review by this Court against the standard of reasonableness (Huruglica at para 35; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para 59 [Khosa]) This is consistent with the presumption stated in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] at paragraph 10 that reasonableness is the applicable standard in all cases. The parties agree that this is the applicable standard of review here. [28] The Court will intervene only if it is satisfied \u201cthere are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency\u201d (Vavilov at para 100). These criteria are met if the reasons allow the Court to understand why the decision was made, and enable the Court to determine whether the decision falls within the range of acceptable outcomes defensible in respect of the facts and law (Vavilov at paras 85-86, citing Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 at para 47). [29] The Zhangs argue that the RAD unreasonably found they had voluntarily relinquished their status in Venezuela. They say they could not be expected to return to Venezuela given their fear of persecution in that country. Furthermore, returning to Venezuela could potentially undermine their refugee claims in Canada. [30] There is no dispute that the Zhangs were excluded from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention at the time the hearing into their claims began in 2015. The RAD found no probative evidence that the Zhangs were unable to return to Venezuela before their status lapsed in 2016. There was nothing to corroborate their claims they had been the victims of violent crime, or that they had been targeted because of their Chinese ancestry. [31] I am satisfied that the RAD reasonably balanced the relevant factors identified by the Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng. It conducted a thorough assessment of the country conditions and potential risks, the Zhangs\u2019 ability to return to Venezuela, and their explanation for allowing their status to lapse. The RAD\u2019s conclusion that the Zhangs had voluntarily relinquished their status in Venezuela, and its determination that Liling and Jianning were excluded from refugee protection under Article 1E of the Convention, were therefore reasonable. C. Did the RAD unreasonably reject the Zhangs\u2019 credibility? [32] The Zhangs argue that the RAD unreasonably found they had no subjective fear of persecution, given their frequent travels between China, Canada, the United States and Venezuela. They say that the RAD made unwarranted assumptions about the way resettled immigrants should behave. While the Zhangs may have been businesspeople, they say they were not sufficiently sophisticated to make enquiries about the asylum processes in each of the countries they visited. [33] The Zhangs cite Maldonado v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1980] 2 FC 302 (FCA) for the proposition that their testimony was presumed to be true, and should not have been rejected unless there were serious reasons to doubt it. However, the Zhangs offered nothing to corroborate their assertions of kidnappings or robberies, and nothing to show they were victims of violence because they were Chinese immigrants. They admit that none of the crimes they allegedly experienced were ever reported to the authorities. [34] The Zhangs are essentially asking this Court to reweigh the evidence, and substitute its view for that of the RAD. But that is not the role of this Court in an application for judicial review (Khosa at para 61). The RAD reasonably found that any risks faced by the Zhangs in Venezuela were generalized and not personal. The RAD\u2019s findings respecting the Zhangs\u2019 credibility are coherent and transparent, and therefore reasonable. IV. Conclusion [35] The application for judicial review is dismissed. None of the parties proposed that a question be certified for appeal.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200113 Docket: IMM-2421-19 Citation: 2020 FC 40 Ottawa, Ontario, January 13, 2020 PRESENT: Associate Chief Justice Gagn\u00e9 BETWEEN: JOS\u00c9E FLORENCE NGO NTAMAG Applicant and MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION, REFUGEES AND CITIZENSHIP CANADA Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Background [1] Jos\u00e9e Florence Ngo Ntamag came to Canada on a student permit that was valid until November 30, 2018. She completed her studies and received an official confirmation of completion on December 4, 2018. However, she waited until February 16, 2019 to request that her status be changed to that of a visitor, so that she would not be without status until and when she applied for a work permit under the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program [PGWPP]. [2] Ms. Ntamag submitted an Application to Change Conditions, Extend my Stay or Remain in Canada as a Visitor or Temporary Resident Permit Holder (IMM 5708), accompanied by a letter from counsel stating that she relied on section 182(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR], which gives temporary residents a 90-day grace period after the lapse of their status to apply for the restoration of that status. [3] Ms. Ntamag now seeks judicial review of the decision made by the Officer to refuse her application. II. Impugned Decision [4] The Officer refused to re-establish Ms. Ntamag\u2019s temporary resident status for the following reasons: \u2022 She failed to submit any proof of funds with her application; \u2022 Although her stated purpose for seeking an extension was to apply for a Post-Graduation Work Permit, to this day, she still has not submitted an application for the Program; \u2022 She had suf\ufb01cient time to ful\ufb01ll her purpose for staying in Canada; \u2022 She did not provide any information showing that she has strong ties to her home country, thus failing to convince the Of\ufb01cer that she would leave Canada at the end of her stay. III. Issues and Standard of Review [5] This application for judicial review raises the following issues: Did the Officer breach his duty of procedural fairness? Did the Officer err in his interpretation of section 182 of the Regulations? [6] In Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (Vavilov), the decision recently released by the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court has revisited in some regards, and clarified in others, the framework for determining the standard of review applicable to administrative decisions. Having carefully reviewed the reasons issued by the majority of the Court, I am of the view that they do not change the standard applicable to both questions raised by the present application. With respect to the interpretation of section 182 of the Regulations, the presumption of reasonableness cannot be rebutted, so that standard applies as it would have prior to Vavilov. [7] With respect to the issue of procedural fairness, since the Supreme Court is silent on the topic (Vavilov, para 23) \u2013 it is fair to conclude that the previous jurisprudence still applies. Therefore, if the Court finds that the duty of procedural fairness owed to the Applicant was breached, it should quash the decision. IV. Analysis Did the Officer breach his duty of procedural fairness? [8] Ms. Ntamag cites the decision of the Court in Zhang v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 1381 to stand for the proposition that an applicant placed in her situation is entitled to either a procedural fairness letter or an examination. Her main argument is that the Officer failed to bring his concerns to her attention prior to rendering a final decision, nor did he provide her with an opportunity to respond. Though this is often done either with a procedural fairness letter sent to an applicant, or during an examination, this is not a hard and fast requirement. In Bui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 440, Justice Ren\u00e9 LeBlanc summarized where an Officer is required to inform an applicant of issues with their application: [26] In the context of a visa application, the case law has held that the level of procedural fairness owed by a visa officer to a visa applicant is on the lower end of the spectrum (Chiau v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 16793 (FCA), [2001] 2 FC 297 (FCA) at para 41; Sapojnikov at para 26; Yang at para 22). [\u2026] [28] When, however, a visa officer\u2019s concern arises directly from the requirements of the Act or regulations, the officer is not normally under an obligation to inform or provide the applicant with an opportunity to address the concerns (Al Aridi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 381 (CanLII) at para 20; Saatchi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1037 (CanLII) at para 40; Hamza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 264 (CanLII) at para 24). [9] The Officer\u2019s concerns arise directly from the requirements of the Regulations: with respect to the proof of funds or the evidence that Ms. Ntamag would leave at the end of her stay (section 179), and to the apparent confusion she made between a fresh application for a different Temporary Resident status (sections 179 and 192) and the restoration of a pre-existing status (section 182). Therefore, the Officer was not under the obligation to issue a procedural fairness letter or conduct an examination, as Ms. Ntamag suggests. [10] In addition, Ms. Ntamag\u2019s reliance on Zhang is, in my view, misplaced. Zhang does not stand for the proposition that a fairness letter or examination are required in all circumstances, including when concerns arise from the plain requirements of the Regulations. In Zhang, the applicant had submitted evidence to support his claim that he was a bona fide student, including a letter which provided details of his program of study at that institution, his successful completion of that program, and his acceptance to a different institution. On that basis, Justice Yves de Montigny found that he was entitled to some explanation as to why these documents were inadequate to show that he was a bona fide student. Yet the reasons provided by the officer did not allow the Court to understand why the application was denied. [11] In the present case, the Officer was not presented with proof of funds or evidence that Ms. Ntamag was a bona fide visitor and that she would leave at the end of her authorized stay. In addition, she admits in counsel\u2019s letter attached to her application that she is no longer a student, that she does not meet the initial conditions for her stay, and that, consequently, she is without status in Canada. [12] The Officer simply applied the Regulations to the set of facts presented to him and explained which of its requirements were not met. I see no breach of procedural fairness on his part. A. Did the Officer err in his interpretation of section 182 of the Regulations? [13] Ms. Ntamag blames the Officer for having provided \u201cboilerplate\u201d and thus insufficient reasons. [14] She further argues that the Officer erred in his interpretation and application of section 182 of the Regulations, which provides the following: 182 (1) On application made by a visitor, worker or student within 90 days after losing temporary resident status as a result of failing to comply with a condition imposed under paragraph 185(a), any of subparagraphs 185(b)(i) to (iii) or paragraph 185(c), an officer shall restore that status if, following an examination, it is established that the visitor, worker or student meets the initial requirements for their stay, has not failed to comply with any other conditions imposed and is not the subject of a declaration made under subsection 220.1(1) of the Act. (2) Despite subsection (1), an officer shall not restore the status of a student who is not in compliance with a condition set out in subsection 220.1(1). [15] In her view, the use of the term \u201cshall\u201d in Section 182(1) means that an Officer has no discretion in choosing whether to restore the status of a visitor, worker, or student if they meet the initial requirements for their stay in Canada. Therefore, she maintains that the Officer mistakenly exercised his discretion in refusing to restore her status. [16] First, I am of the view that the Officer provided sufficient reasons, especially given that the GCMS Notes are considered as part of those reasons (Paddayuman v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 287 at para 13; Song v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 72 at para 18). In addition, the Supreme Court in Vavilov states that, in accordance with well-established law, reasons are not required for all administrative decisions (Vavilov at paras 77, 119, 136-137). [17] The requirements for an IMM 5708 Application are clearly listed on the IRCC\u2019s Document Checklist Form IMM-5558. These requirements include proof of means of support, as well as all documents related to study or work permits. While Ms. Ntamag\u2019s record does include a letter dated September 7, 2017 from her brother attesting that he was supporting her during her academic studies at La Cit\u00e9, no further or update to this proof of support is enclosed. Therefore, the Officer\u2019s finding that she had not included sufficient proof of support is reasonable. If her brother was to continue to support her during her stay in Canada, then it was incumbent on her to provide documentation to this effect. Ms. Ntamag provided no explanation why this proof was not included in her Application. [18] Ms. Ntamag also did not include any proof that she had applied to the PWGPP, nor does her Application mention any intention to do so. Yet, Ms. Ntamag was represented by counsel who was likely familiar with the IMM 5708 process for visa extensions and restoration of status. However, Ms. Ntamag has offered no explanation as to why she failed to include these two pieces of required information. She has also not submitted any evidence that she has applied for a PGWPP since February 2019. [19] Given that the application is missing several required elements, and that Ms. Ntamag has not explained these gaps in her materials, I find the Officer\u2019s conclusions reasonable. [20] Second, I am also of the view that the officer did not err in his interpretation of section 182 of the Regulations. Subsection 220.1(1), which is referenced in Subsection 182(2), makes it clear that an Officer must not restore the status of temporary resident\u2019s Study Permit if they are not currently enrolled at a designated learning institution or actively pursuing their course or program. As Ms. Ntamag was not in compliance with these conditions at the time of her Application, the Officer\u2019s interpretation of Section 182 and its relevant provisions was reasonable. [21] One of the conditions imposed on a PGWPP applicant is that the application be sent before the expiry of the applicant\u2019s Study Permit. As Ms. Ntamag did not meet that condition, she asked to be granted a Visitor permit to be valid until January 1st, 2021. [22] However, just as section 182 and the 90-day grace period that it provides do not apply to a former student seeking a PGWPP, they do not apply to a former student seeking to obtain a Visitor Permit. Ms. Ntamag could not simply rely on section 182 to obtain a different Temporary Residence status than the one she had held before she applied (Nookala v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1019). V. Conclusion [23] Given that Ms. Ntamag did not provide key documents in her Application, and that the Officer\u2019s assessment of her Application and interpretation of Section 182 of the Regulations is reasonable, this application for judicial review is dismissed. [24] Neither party has submitted a question for certification, and none arises from the facts of this case.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200117 Docket: IMM-2877-19 Citation: 2020 FC 60 Toronto, Ontario, January 17, 2020 PRESENT: Madam Justice Simpson BETWEEN: BIBIANA PETER Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS (Delivered orally from the Bench in Toronto, Ontario on January 16, 2020) I. PROCEEDING [1] This application is for judicial review of a decision of a Senior Immigration Officer [the Officer] of Citizenship and Immigration Canada dated April 11, 2019 [the Decision], in which the Officer denied the Applicant\u2019s application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds. This application was brought pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA]. II. BACKGROUND [2] The Applicant is a 57-year-old citizen of St. Lucia. She is single. She has two adult sons and two sisters who live in St. Lucia. She also has an adult son who is a Canadian permanent resident [the Canadian Son]. He lives here with his wife and stepdaughter. [3] The Applicant arrived in Canada in 2004. She overstayed her visa and has lived here without status since that time. She has worked as a caregiver for the elderly as she had previously done in St. Lucia. However, she did not have a work permit and did not demonstrate that she had paid taxes on her income in Canada. [4] In 2015, the Applicant was diagnosed with breast cancer. She is now in remission but takes Tamoxifen daily and needs to have her eyes checked every six months to monitor for problems that Tamoxifen may cause. [5] Currently, the Applicant\u2019s Canadian Son and his wife provide her with financial and emotional support. They also help her with her doctor appointments. [6] The Applicant believes that if she is returned to St. Lucia, she will face financial and medical hardship. She believes she will be unable to find employment due to her age and lack of formal education. She also believes that she will not be able to pay for the medical care she needs. She does not allege that this care is unavailable. Her concern is the cost. [7] The Applicant\u2019s two sons in St. Lucia are not able to help pay for her medical treatments. However, the Applicant\u2019s Canadian Son has expressed a willingness to support her financially. III. THE DECISION [8] Regarding establishment, the Officer found that establishment was not a strong positive factor because the Applicant has not respected Canadian immigration law. [9] Regarding medical care, the Officer found that he had no information about the cost of Tamoxifen and eye exams and no corroboration of her inability to pay. This was significant in view of the Canadian Son\u2019s willingness to provide financial support. [10] In conclusion, the Officer did not find the Applicant\u2019s case compelling and found that it did not justify a positive decision. IV. THE ISSUES Is the Decision unreasonable because the Officer conducted a hardship-centric analysis? Is the Decision unreasonable because the Officer required the Applicant to corroborate her inability to pay for her medical treatment? Is the Decision unreasonable because the Officer discounted the Applicant\u2019s establishment? V. ISSUE 1 \u2013 HARDSHIP-CENTRIC [11] In my view, the Decision cannot fairly be described as \u201chardship centric\u201d. The Applicant is healthy, although in need of twice yearly eye exams and Tamoxifen, has an established career as a caregiver for the elderly, has job prospects in St. Lucia, has family there and has the financial support of her Canadian Son. [12] Certainly hardships were considered because the Applicant framed her concerns about returning to St. Lucia as hardships. There was nothing unreasonable about this approach as part of a broad comprehensive analysis which included consideration of other factors such as her Canadian Son, her friends in Canada, her Canadian church and her establishment. The positive factors were not discounted by reason of her improper stay in Canada. Rather, all factors were balanced and the positive factors were ultimately outweighed. VI. ISSUE 2 \u2013 MEDICAL ISSUES [13] The concern the Applicant expressed in her evidence was whether medical treatment in St. Lucia would be available to her given its cost and her alleged inability to pay. [14] In my view, in the absence of any information about the actual costs and given the Canadian Son\u2019s offer of help, it was reasonable of the Officer to expect the Applicant to substantiate her claim that she could not afford treatment. VII. ISSUE 3 - ESTABLISHMENT [15] The Federal Court of Appeal in Legault v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 125 has made clear that an Officer is entitled to consider an applicant\u2019s time in Canada without authorisation as a negative factor. In this case, the Officer indicated that the Applicant had not demonstrated \u201cstrong\u201d establishment due to her breach of Canadian immigration laws. In my view, the Officer treated establishment as a neutral to negative factor and this was reasonable. VIII. CONCLUSION [16] For all these reasons the application will be dismissed. IX. CERTIFICATION [17] No question was posed for certification for appeal. JUDGMENT in IMM-2877-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that the application for judicial review is dismissed. \u201cSandra J.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200108 Docket: IMM-3146-18 Citation: 2020 FC 20 Ottawa, Ontario, January 8, 2020 PRESENT: Madam Justice Walker BETWEEN: 1397280 ONTARIO LTD. Applicant and THE MINISTER OF EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT CANADA/SERVICE CANADA Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] On May 6, 2019, the Respondent brought a motion in writing pursuant to Rule 369 of the Federal Courts Rules, SOR/98-106, (Rules) to strike the Applicant\u2019s Application for leave and judicial review of a decision of a program officer at Employment and Social Development Canada. The officer refused to issue a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) which would have allowed the Applicant to hire a temporary foreign worker, Mr. Nakamura. The Respondent argues that the Application is now moot. [2] For the reasons that follow, the Respondent\u2019s motion will be granted and the Application struck out. I. Background [3] The Applicant operates a private English as a Second Language (ESL) institution. On May 3, 2018, the Applicant submitted an LMIA application in order to hire Mr. Nakamura. The LMIA request was refused by the program officer on June 15, 2018 (Original Decision). [4] On July 6, 2018, the Applicant filed this Application for leave and judicial review and requested that the Original Decision be set aside and the matter sent back for redetermination by a different program officer. [5] On November 7, 2018, the Applicant filed a second LMIA application for Mr. Nakamura for employment in a very similar position. In this second application, the Applicant addressed the deficiencies highlighted by the program officer in the Original Decision. The second LMIA application was approved and a positive LMIA was issued to the Applicant on January 31, 2019 (January 2019 Decision). [6] The Respondent submits that the January 2019 Decision renders the remedy sought by the Applicant in the Application moot and that the Application should not be considered by this Court. II. The Test on Motions to Strike Applications for Judicial Review [7] I note first that the Respondent relies on Rule 221 in support of its motion. Rule 221(1) permits the Court to strike out a statement of claim on the ground that it discloses no reasonable cause of action. Rule 221 is contained in Part 4 of the Rules, which applies to all proceedings that are not applications or appeals (Rule 169). There is no corresponding rule in Part 5 of the Rules, which governs proceedings brought by way of application. Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s motion to strike cannot be considered by reference to Rule 221. [8] Notwithstanding the absence from Part 5 of a rule analogous to Rule 221, in David Bull Laboratories Canada) Inc v Pharmacia Inc, [1995] 1 FC 588 (CA) (David Bull), the Federal Court of Appeal held that the Court has the jurisdiction to strike a notice of application \u201cwhich is so clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success\u201d (David Bull at page 600). [9] Recently, Justice Stratas confirmed that the threshold for striking an application is the same as that for striking an action (Wenham v Canada, 2018 FCA 199 at para 33 (Wenham)): [33] \u2026 In motions to strike applications for judicial review, this Court uses the same threshold. It uses the \u201cplain and obvious\u201d threshold commonly used in motions to strike actions, sometimes also called the \u201cdoomed to fail\u201d standard. Taking the facts pleaded as true, the Court examines whether the application: \u2026is \u201cso clearly improper as to be bereft of any possibility of success\u201d: David Bull Laboratories (Canada) Inc. v. Pharmacia Inc., [1995] 1 F.C. 588 at page 600 (C.A.). There must be a \u201cshow stopper\u201d or a \u201cknockout punch\u201d \u2013 an obvious, fatal flaw striking at the root of this Court\u2019s power to entertain the application: Rahman v. Public Service Labour Relations Board, 2013 FCA 117 at paragraph 7; Donaldson v. Western Grain Storage By-Products, 2012 FCA 286 at paragraph 6; cf. Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959. (Canada (National Revenue) v. JP Morgan Asset Management (Canada) Inc., 2013 FCA 250, [2014] 2 F.C.R. 557 at para. 47.) [10] In order to determine whether an application for judicial review discloses a cause of action, the Court must first focus on the notice of application itself to identify its essential character (Wenham at para 34). III. Is the Application Moot? [11] The Respondent bases its motion to strike on the premise that the Application is moot, arguing that mootness is a reason for \u201cfinding no possibility of success\u201d. The Respondent\u2019s argument is supported by the jurisprudence. In Wenham, Justice Stratas referred to mootness as a preliminary objection that can be fatal to any possibility of success of an application (Wenham at para 36; see also Rahman v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCT 137 at paras 9-10). In Luk\u00e1cs v Canada (President, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, 2015 FC 267 (Luk\u00e1cs), Justice MacTavish, as she then was, stated that the Court\u2019s jurisdiction to strike a proceeding for mootness derives from its inherent jurisdiction to control its own process (Luk\u00e1cs at para 24). [12] The determination of mootness of an application before the Court involves a two-step process (Borowski v Canada (Attorney-General), [1989] 1 SCR 342 (Borowski)). The first step is the obvious starting point: the consideration of whether a live controversy which affects the rights of the parties continues to exist. If not, the Court will generally decline to hear the case as it is moot. However, the Court retains discretion to hear the case and must consider the exercise of its discretion before finally determining whether or not to proceed. The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) described the process as follows (Borowski at page 353): The approach in recent cases involves a two-step analysis. First it is necessary to determine whether the required tangible and concrete dispute has disappeared and the issues have become academic. Second, if the response to the first question is affirmative, it is necessary to decide if the court should exercise its discretion to hear the case. The cases do not always make it clear whether the term \u201cmoot\u201d applies to cases that do not present a concrete controversy or whether the term applies only to such of those cases as the court declines to hear. In the interest of clarity, I consider that a case is moot if it fails to meet the \u201clive controversy\u201d test. A court may nonetheless elect to address a moot issue if the circumstances warrant. [13] The SCC identified three factors a court should consider in assessing whether to exercise its discretion to hear a case on its merits even though it is moot: the adversarial system, the concern for judicial economy, and the court\u2019s proper law-making role (Borowski at pages 358\u2011363). The SCC stated that the factors should not be reviewed mechanically and acknowledged that the factors may weigh differently in any particular case. [14] The Applicant submits that the Application is not moot and should be considered by the Court for three reasons: (1) the case addresses novel issues in an area of limited jurisprudence; (2) the Respondent has not \u201cconclusively established that the initial decision was correct or reasonable\u201d; and (3) the Applicant incurred $1000.00 in fees in applying for the second LMIA. [15] In order to determine whether the required tangible and concrete dispute between the parties has disappeared, I return to the Applicant\u2019s Notice of Application. In the Notice, the Applicant requested the following relief: That the decision of the Program Officer be set aside and sent back to be re-determined by a differently constituted decision maker in accordance with such directions as the Court considers to be appropriate. [16] In light of the issuance of the January 2019 Decision, I find that the Application is moot. The Applicant\u2019s purpose in seeking judicial review of the Original Decision was to have its initial LMIA application reconsidered and a positive LMIA issued. The January 2019 Decision approved the Applicant\u2019s second application for an LMIA, for the same individual in a similar position, thereby providing the very relief the Applicant is seeking from this Court in the Application. There remains no tangible and concrete dispute or \u2018live controversy\u2019 between the parties. Any consideration of the Original Decision would be academic. [17] Turning to the second part of the Borowski process, I find that the circumstances of this case do not warrant the exercise of the Court\u2019s discretion. There clearly remains no adversarial context. The essential issue between the parties, namely the issuance of a positive LMIA for the employment of Mr. Nakamura by the Applicant, has been resolved. No practical purpose would be served by reviewing the Original Decision for reasonableness. An order of the Court granting the remedy sought by the Applicant, that of returning the matter for redetermination, would result in redundancy. [18] Despite the Applicant\u2019s brief reference in its motion submissions to the presence of novel issues and to a paucity of jurisprudence, in its Memorandum of Fact and Law in support of the Application, the Applicant makes note of \u201cnumerous\u201d decisions of this Court regarding the flaws it identifies in the Original Decision. In addition, the Applicant\u2019s arguments in support of the Application relate only to the specific facts of its case. The Application raises no legal issues of general importance which would overcome the principle of judicial economy. [19] Finally, the Applicant argues that the Court should exercise its jurisdiction to hear the Application because the Applicant had to pay a second LMIA application fee to obtain the January 2019 Decision. I do not agree. The Applicant chose to submit a second LMIA application, and to pay a second application fee, rather than to wait and pursue the Application to its conclusion. The fact that the Applicant elected to proceed in this manner does not warrant the exercise of the Court\u2019s discretion to consider the substance of the arguments raised in the Application. IV. Conclusion [20] The Motion is granted. [21] I make no award of costs in this matter. JUDGMENT IN IMM-3146-18 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The Respondent\u2019s motion to strike is granted and this application for leave and judicial review is struck out.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR: TB925117 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Charles Dorsette (the Appellant) is a citizen of the Bahamas. He was born in the Bahamas to his Bahamian citizen parents and is of Haitian descent. He alleges a fear of returning to the Bahamas based on his ethnicity, as a Haitian Bahamian. He alleges surviving years of racist harassment, discrimination, physical assaults, and death threats. He also alleges that he was targeted multiple times by Bahamian immigration authorities in night raids on his family home. He alleges that authorities directed his family to \u201cgo back where they came from\u201d even after they provided their Bahamian passports. He appeals a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), rejecting his claim for refugee protection. The RPD denied the Appellant\u2019s claim on three grounds: (1) his testimony was inconsistent and lacking in credibility; (2) his failure to claim asylum in the United States (US) and his return to the Bahamas undermines his subjective fear; and (3) the discrimination does not rise to persecution. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred on all three grounds. He has not submitted any new evidence and I have no jurisdiction to convene an oral hearing. My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. Having independently assessed all the evidence, I find that the RPD erred. I find that the RPD was microscopic in its overall credibility analysis, erred in finding the Appellant lacks subjective fear, and improperly assessed the objective evidence. I further find that the RPD was dismissive of the severity of the alleged persecution and relied on discriminatory tropes in questioning the Appellant about his failure to claim asylum in the US. I find that the Appellant is credible, on a balance of probabilities, and that he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution as a Bahamian of Haitian descent. I further find that he is a Convention refugee. DECISION The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee. ANALYSIS The RPD erred overall in assessing the Appellant\u2019s credibility and subjective fear The RPD made several adverse credibility findings. While I have upheld one of the RPD\u2019s uncontested credibility findings, I find the remainder to be in error. The RPD\u2019s microscopic credibility findings are in error The RPD\u2019s credibility findings are largely based on what it characterized as inconsistencies between the Appellant\u2019s testimony and his Basis of Claim (BOC) form. Counsel argues that these credibility findings are in error because they are microscopic. I agree. It is not necessary to go over each of the RPD\u2019s credibility findings. Many are based on minutia and grounded in a misapprehension of the evidence. I have provided a summary below: In his BOC, the Appellant alleges that his family was threatened and assaulted. The RPD found that the Appellant\u2019s testimony was inconsistent as he \u201ctestified that they [his family] were just verbally attacked, but never assaulted.\u201d This is incorrect. When asked whether there was violence towards his mother or sisters, the Appellant testified \u201cyes, they would throw rocks at us.\u201d As the Appellant correctly testified, \u201cthrowing rocks is considered an assault.\u201d In misapprehending the Appellant\u2019s testimony, the RPD erred. The adverse inference it drew is without foundation. In his BOC, the Appellant alleges that he asked \u201cmultiple police officers\u201d for help and that nothing ever came of these requests. In testimony, the Appellant explained that a complaint was made about the rock assault when there were multiple officers at the police station. The RPD found this explanation conflicts with his BOC where he \u201cappears to say that he went to the police multiple times.\u201d I find that no inconsistency arises. The fact that the Appellant approached the police after the rock incident does not conflict with his allegation that there were multiple police officers at the police station following the rock incident. The RPD found that beyond indicating a fear of authorities involved in the immigration raids, the Appellant alleged mistreatment by \u201cpeople of his own age, without specifying further.\u201d This is incorrect. The Appellant testified in detail about his fear of men in the community, some of whom he knew from school, who targeted him based on his ethnicity. In his BOC, the Appellant alleges that in 2014, he was running away from \u201csomeone\u201d and later in the narrative, he alleges that he was running from a \u201cgroup.\u201d The RPD asked the Appellant why he had written \u201csomeone\u201d and not \u201csome people\u201d in his BOC. He explained that he didn\u2019t notice how many people there were as he was terrified. I find this to be a trivial difference. The RPD\u2019s finding is microscopic and in error. The Appellant alleged that he approached the police twice and his sister\u2019s letter says he approached the police \u201cmultiple\u201d times. The RPD found this to be inconsistent. I disagree. This is a distinction without a difference. The RPD\u2019s finding is in error. The above findings illustrate the RPD\u2019s erroneous approach to assessing the Appellant\u2019s credibility. In Wang, the Federal Court was clear that this kind of microscopic examination of the evidence is in error. The Board should not act with \u201czeal to find the applicant unbelievable.\u201d Unchallenged finding about the Appellant\u2019s inconsistent school letter is correct The RPD identified an inconsistency between the Appellant\u2019s allegations and a support letter from a school in the Bahamas regarding injuries he suffered at the age of 12. While the Appellant alleged that he was physically assaulted by classmates and that the school authorities contacted the police, the support letter indicates that he was feeling dizzy and nauseous and that he slipped in the school shower. The Appellant explained that the author was simply suffering from poor memory. The RPD rejected this explanation and accorded no weight to the letter. Counsel does not challenge this finding on appeal. In my own independent assessment, I find that the RPD is correct. I note that the Appellant provided a series of text messages to support his explanation for the inconsistency. However, in this exchange he is the one who states that he \u201ccan\u2019t remember\u201d the incident. Conversely, there is no indication that the author of the school letter suffers from any memory impairment. I reject the Appellant\u2019s explanation and I accord no weight to this letter as it contradicts the Appellant\u2019s testimony. While this document undermines the Appellant\u2019s credibility with respect to his physical assault when he was a 12 year-old, I find that it does not undermine his otherwise credible allegation that he is a survivor of racist stigma and discrimination over two decades. The RPD erred in assessing the Appellant\u2019s subjective fear The RPD drew adverse inferences based on the Appellant\u2019s failure to claim in the US while he was on a study permit, his failure to claim in Canada during a week long trip with his mother as a teenager, and his return to the Bahamas during his US studies and after his trip to Canada as a teenager. Counsel argues that each of these findings are in error. I agree. In addition, while not raised by Counsel, I have also considered whether the RPD relied on discriminatory stereotypes in questioning the Appellant about his failure to claim asylum in the US. First, the Appellant remained in status for the duration of his time in the US and was not at risk of removal. As the Federal Court has found on multiple occasions, the possession of valid immigration status may reasonably explain a delay in claiming or a failure to claim. Moreover, the treatment of asylum seekers in the US has recently been addressed by the Federal Court in Canadian Council for Refugees. In finding Canada\u2019s refugee sharing agreement with the US unconstitutional, the Court notes that \u201cresponsibility sharing cannot be positively balanced against imprisonment or the deleterious effects of cruel and unusual detention conditions, solitary confinement, and the risk of refoulement.\u201d I recognize that the Court\u2019s decision is with respect to those returned from Canada to the US to make their claim. However, I find the conditions outlined in the decision relevant to asylum seekers in the US more generally. Considering these conditions, I find that the Appellant\u2019s failure to make a claim in the US is reasonable. Second, the Appellant was a teenager during his short trip with his mother to Canada. I find that his age reasonably explains his failure to make a claim in Canada in 2012. Third, The Appellant is clear that the event which crystalized his fear occurred following the racist death threat just before he fled the Bahamas in 2017 and made his claim upon entry to Canada. Reavailment \u201cdoes not preclude an applicant from making a claim if there are subsequent events of persecution that precipitate flight.\u201d In addition, I am troubled by the RPD\u2019s Member\u2019s questioning of the Appellant about his fear of claiming asylum in the US as a young Black man. After asking the Appellant \u201cwhy would you feel you wouldn\u2019t be safe as a young Black man\u201d the Appellant responds that his fear is a result of his knowledge of \u201caltercations with police officers, racism especially.\u201d In response, the RPD Member states: \u201cI don\u2019t have any documents right now, but I believe that in the States, the most frequent crime for young Black men is other young Black men, it\u2019s Black on Black.\u201d The RPD Member\u2019s comment about crime in the US is based on her own speculation. Her reference to \u201cBlack on Black\u201d crime is a crude description of intracommunity violence and it relies on racist tropes about the criminality of Black men. Moreover, it is a deflection. In making this comment, the RPD Member fails to engage with the specific fear of anti-Black racism and police violence expressed by the Appellant in his testimony. Even in her Reasons, the RPD Member finds that the Appellant could safely seek asylum in the US as a Black man by going \u201csomewhere in the US where there is less crime.\u201d Again, the RPD Member fails to engage with the Appellant\u2019s fear of anti-Black racist violence, instead of her speculation that he is at risk of \u201cBlack on Black\u201d crime. This is an error. The Appellant\u2019s fear of anti-Black racism, the reason underpinning his failure to claim asylum in the US, is supported by the objective evidence. The disproportionate rate of police violence in Black communities is well documented in the US National Documentation Package (NDP), an exhibit that the RPD entered into evidence. Credibility summary The RPD\u2019s microscopic credibility findings and subjective fear determination are in error. While I have upheld one of the RPD\u2019s adverse credibility findings, I find that this adverse inference is insufficient to rebut the presumption of truthfulness. The RPD erred in its overall credibility finding. Upon my own independent assessment, I find the Appellant\u2019s testimony about the racist harm and discrimination that he suffered in the Bahamas detailed, spontaneous, and compelling. I find the Appellant credible, on a balance of probabilities. The Appellant\u2019s claim against the Bahamas is well-founded The RPD found that the Appellant\u2019s allegation of discrimination based on Haitian descent does not rise to the level of persecution in the Bahamas. Counsel argues that this finding was made without regard to the preponderance of the objective evidence. I agree. While the RPD is presumed to have considered all the evidence before it, I find that the RPD erred in failing to consider objective evidence which runs contrary to its findings. I further find that the RPD was dismissive of the harm that the Appellant alleged. The RPD\u2019s dismissive comment about the Appellant\u2019s allegations The RPD dismisses the Appellant\u2019s traumatic experience of state targeting in the Bahamas, finding that \u201cthere is no evidence of any harm done to the family except perhaps for being woken up. This characterization is wrong. It is not the case that the Appellant and his family members were simply \u2018woken up.\u2019 As the Appellant explains, Bahamian immigration authorities entered his family\u2019s home many times late in the night, pulled his entire family out of bed, insulted their Haitian descent, and yelled at them to \u201cgo back to Haiti\u201d and \u201cgo back where we came from.\u201d When they presented officials with their Bahamian passports \u201cthey would yell that they were fake and that we did voodoo (a stereotype about Haitians).\u201d At no time does the RPD impugn these allegations. These experiences were devastating for the Appellant and his family. As he explains, \u201cIt hurt to see my mother break down because of all the hate that we experienced.\u201d These raids are not just traumatic. The objective evidence establishes that they are enabled by the systemic targeting of people of Haitian descent by the Bahamian state, regardless of their citizenship. The RPD is incorrect in its finding that \u201cthere is no infringement on [the Appellant\u2019s] fundamental human rights.\u201d Targeting based on race or ethnicity is a clear violation of fundamental human rights and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights protects against arbitrary interference in the home. Discrimination rising to persecution As the Supreme Court found in Ward, persecution is the \u201csustained or systemic violation of basic human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection.\u201d The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) indicates in its Handbook that discrimination rises to persecution where there are a number of discriminatory acts substantially prejudicial to the person concerned, which take place in a general atmosphere of insecurity, and which result in a feeling of apprehension and insecurity with regard to the future existence of the person concerned. In determining whether the Appellant faces a serious possibility of persecution upon return to the Bahamas, I am guided by the Decision of another Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) panel, identified as a Reason of Interest (X (Re), 2020 CanLII 24189). This decision situates the assessment of persecution within a human rights framework, as follows: [8] \u2026 This test must be understood within the context set out by Hathaway, who explains that the assessment of persecution must be done in the context of human rights law. This human rights based approach to assessing persecution is not intended to be hierarchical or categorical but rather flexible and fluid allowing for decision-makers to \u201ctake account of the cumulative human rights impact of the various harms alleged in order to arrive at a synthesized assessment of the \u2018totality of the claim.\u2019\u201d In this assessment, decision makers must consider: the situation in the country and whether the government is creating an atmosphere of intolerance; the consequences of the discrimination, including whether there are impacts on an ability to access education, healthcare, and jobs, which lead to an insecure future existence; the personal circumstances of the Appellant and any vulnerabilities; and the cumulative nature of the discrimination and whether it rises to persecution. In accordance with this framework of analysis, I will: (i) consider the environment in the country of origin and the contextual circumstances; (ii) examine the Appellant\u2019s personal circumstances; and having considered these cumulative factors, (iii) determine whether the Appellant faces systemic or persistent harm which leads to an insecure future existence. The environment in the country of origin and contextual circumstances The RPD acknowledged that \u201canti-Haitian prejudice and resentment regarding Haitian immigration is widespread\u201d and that beginning in 2014, \u201cthe government began conducting large-scale immigration raids in Haitian neighbourhoods.\u201d However, the RPD found that the Appellant\u2019s situation is different from Haitian immigrants as he is a Bahamian citizen. The RPD is correct that the Appellant is not at risk of deportation to Haiti and that his citizenship status is relevant to an assessment of whether the harm he alleges rises to persecution. However, the RPD fails to assess the objective evidence before it which specifically speaks to the treatment of Bahamian citizens of Haitian descent. In particular, the RPD fails to address any of the objective evidence filed by the Appellant and his Counsel. From my own review, I note the following: \u201cUnderstanding racialization and how it relates to power is important\u201d because of harmful racial myths and stereotypes, including that \u201cHaitians are perceived to be more African and thus less modernized than Bahamians, which impacts [] relations of power\u201d; There is \u201cxenophobia and disdain\u201d directed at the Haitian community in the Bahamas and \u201clittle distinction\u201d is made between different categories of Haitians, including those who are Bahamian citizens of Haitian descent; There is a social hierarchy in Bahamian citizenship creating a second-class citizenship category. Many Haitians with Bahamian citizenship \u201cstill experience discrimination\u201d because they are not considered \u201creal Bahamians\u201d; Bahamian immigration raids have targeted Haitians in their homes, churches, and workplaces. Multiple sources in the objective evidence confirm that these raids also target Bahamian citizens of Haitian descent. The \u201cgovernment acknowledges that even Bahamian citizens with French surnames are frequently arrested by mistake.\u201d When citizens are arrested, they are told that they have a \u201cforeign last name\u201d and that they must still come with the authorities despite presenting their Bahamian passport; and The first institution where children of Haitian descent are exposed to \u201cthe idea of being the \u2018other\u2019\u201d is primary school. \u201cStigma, prejudice, and discrimination follow them or people they know through their primary and secondary education.\u201d This \u201cstigma begins in school and continues into adulthood,\u201d from barriers in the workplace, to stigma and hostility persisting in public places \u201csuch as the bus, public hospital, and everyday encounters on the street if one is heard speaking Creole.\u201d In addition, Bahamians with French sounding names have been targeted as \u201csurnames can be an indictor of ethnicity and used to discriminate.\u201d The RPD does not refer to or consider any of this evidence. I recognize that the RPD is not required to refer to every piece of evidence on record. However, the more important and relevant a piece of evidence is, the more significant the RPD\u2019s failure to deal with that evidence. It is open to the RPD to explain why evidence which runs contrary to its findings has been given less weight, or why some evidence is preferred over other evidence. However, to ignore significant contrary evidence is an error. I find that the RPD erred. From my own review of this objective evidence, I find that the stigma, discrimination, and state targeting of Bahamians of Haitians descent is persistent. Bahamian citizenship does not shield those of Haitian descent. When considered cumulatively, I find that the objective evidence establishes that the Bahamian government is creating an atmosphere of intolerance. This systematic discrimination impacts access to education, healthcare, and employment. The Appellant\u2019s personal circumstances The RPD notes that the Appellant finished high school in the Bahamas, that he was able to secure a benefactor to pay for his post-secondary eduction in the US, and that this same benefactor provided him with employment at a law firm in the Bahamas. The RPD also notes that the Appellant\u2019s parents were employed in the Bahamas, his father as a public lawyer before his death, and his mother as a nurse. The RPD was correct to consider these personal circumstances. However, the RPD failed to consider the Appellant\u2019s other circumstances which, when considered alongside the objective evidence, give rise to a serious possibility of persecution. Specifically, the Appellant\u2019s surname is French, and he speaks Creole. The objective evidence is clear that persons of Haitian descent are targeted in the Bahamas based on their French surnames and based on their use of the Creole language. The Appellant has credibly alleged that he suffered multiple such attacks in the past. I do not find that his ability to finish high school or his employment at his benefactor\u2019s law firm mitigate his risk of future discrimination. I find that the Appellant\u2019s particular circumstances increase his vulnerability to discrimination which rises to persecution upon return to the Bahamas. Systemic or persistent harm leading to an insecure future existence Having considered the country conditions and the Appellant\u2019s personal circumstances, I find that the consequences of discrimination based on Haitian descent are persistent and result in a feeling of insecurity in the Appellant regarding his future existence. I find that the cumulative discrimination he faces in the Bahamas gives rise to a serious possibility of persecution. The Appellant does not have access to adequate state protection in the Bahamas Having considered the entire Record, I find that there is clear and convincing evidence that the Bahamian state would be unable to provide the Appellant with adequate protection. I acknowledge that the Bahamas is a constitutional parliamentary democracy. However, a state\u2019s democratic status should not be used as a \u201cproxy for state protection\u201d without examining the quality of institutions, the operational adequacy of protection, and the treatment of similarly situated persons by the state. In addition, a decision-maker \u201cmust focus on actual, operational adequacy, rather than a state\u2019s \u2018efforts\u2019 to protect its citizens.\u201d Where the \u201cdocumentary evidence situates the individual claimant\u2019s experience as part of a broader pattern of state inability or refusal to extend protection, then the absence of state protection is made out.\u201d I find the documentary evidence supports such a pattern in the Appellant\u2019s circumstances. The Bahamian constitution guarantees fundamental rights and the government has enacted legislation to prohibit employment discrimination based on race and national origin. However, these protections are ineffectively enforced. While the state is not expected to afford perfect protection, authorities must be able and willing to implement law and procedure. Despite seeking police assistance on multiple occasions, the Appellant was not provided with adequate state protection. In addition, while the government generally observed prohibitions against arbitrary arrest and detention, this is \u201cwith the exception of immigration raids\u201d and reports of \u201chabitual warrantless entry of homes by immigration officers without probable cause.\u201d The Bahamian state admits to the \u201cfrequent\u201d arbitrary arrest of its own citizens based on their Haitian descent. This policy of state targeting continues despite sanctions by the Court. When I consider the \u201cactual adequacy of state protection\u201d rather than \u201cthe willingness of the state or the efforts it has made to correct discrimination\u201d I find that Bahamian state protection is operationally inadequate. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that operationally adequate state protection would not be forthcoming in the Appellant\u2019s circumstances. The Appellant does not have a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in the Bahamas While the RPD did not make an IFA determination in its reasons, it did canvass the availability of an IFA in the Bahamas during the hearing. Having assessed the evidence, I find that discrimination rising to persecution based on Haitian descent exists throughout the country. I find that there is no safe and reasonable IFA for the Appellant in the Bahamas. CONCLUSION The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Charles Dorsette', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 25, 'end': 27}, {'text': '12', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1069, 'end': 1070}, {'text': 'a 12 year', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1258, 'end': 1261}, {'text': 'high school', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3606, 'end': 3608}, {'text': 'post-secondary eduction', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3624, 'end': 3628}, {'text': 'law firm', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3643, 'end': 3645}, {'text': 'a public lawyer', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3667, 'end': 3670}, {'text': 'nurse', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3679, 'end': 3680}, {'text': 'high school', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3789, 'end': 3791}, {'text': 'law firm', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 3798, 'end': 3800}, {'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 4389, 'end': 4390}, {'text': '12', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 1069, 'end': 1070}, {'text': '12 year', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 1259, 'end': 1261}, {'text': 'a', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 1258, 'end': 1259}, {'text': 'Charles Dorsette', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 25, 'end': 27}, {'text': 'high school', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3606, 'end': 3608}, {'text': 'post-secondary eduction', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3624, 'end': 3628}, {'text': 'law firm', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3643, 'end': 3645}, {'text': 'a public lawyer', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3667, 'end': 3670}, {'text': 'nurse', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3679, 'end': 3680}, {'text': 'high school', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3789, 'end': 3791}, {'text': 'law firm', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 3798, 'end': 3800}]", "label": "accepted"}

Their claim for refugee protection, based on the Principal Appellant\u2019s political opinion and their Tigrayan ethnicity, was rejected by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in assessing their claim and ask the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow their appeal and determine that they are Convention refugees. Alternatively, the Appellants request that the matter be returned to the RPD for redetermination. DETERMINATION I allow this appeal and substitute my own determination that the Appellants are Convention refugees. BACKGROUND The Appellants alleged before the RPD that the Principal Appellant became a member of the Ethiopian Social Democratic Party in 2015. Following a trip to the USA in 2017, he was visited by police officers who accused him of meeting with foreign-based opposition groups and helping to create an uprising. He was arrested and detained in April 2017. While in detention, he was beaten and interrogated. He was released on bail after 14 days. The Principal Appellant\u2019s business establishment was destroyed by individuals in the Oromo region in September 2018. When he went to the site to inspect the damage, people showed up and ordered him to leave the land because of his ethnicity, which was the same as the dominant faction in the ruling party at the time. When he and his business partner went to the police to make a complaint, they were beaten by the Oromo policemen and suffered injuries that required hospitalization. Following this incident, police and other individuals the Principal Appellant did not know came to his house and threatened to kill him and harm his family. The Appellants fear that they can be killed, jailed and tortured because of their perceived political opinion and ethnicity. The Appellants\u2019 claim for refugee protection was heard by the RPD on November 5, 2019. In an oral decision on the same date, the RPD found that the claim failed due to the change of circumstances in Ethiopia. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its assessment of the change of circumstances in Ethiopia. ADMISSIBILITY OF NEW EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL As provided for in subsection 110(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Appeal Act (IRPA), with certain exceptions, the RAD must proceed without a hearing on the basis of the record of the proceedings of the RPD, and may accept documentary evidence and written submissions from the Minister and the person who is the subject of the appeal. Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA provides that the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim, or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection. The Appellants ask that three articles be allowed into evidence. Two of these articles postdate the rejection of the claim and one predates the rejection of the claim by three days. All three articles discuss current country conditions in Ethiopia. The Appellants submit that this new evidence makes it clear that the change of circumstances in Ethiopia is not durable, substantial, or meaningful enough to lead to the conclusion that their fear of persecution is no longer well-founded. They submit that the one article that predates the rejection of their claim only does so by three days, was published after the deadline for disclosing documents to the RPD, and did not come to their attention until after the hearing date. They submit that the decision was delivered from the bench on the date of the hearing and so the article could not have been submitted before the decision was rendered. I will allow all three articles into evidence. I find that the information contained in the articles is relevant and credible and provides updated information on the situation in Ethiopia. I accept that the Appellants would not have been able to submit the one article dated three days before the decision to the RPD, given the short amount of time, the deadline for submitting documents had passed and because they were not aware of the existence of the article until after the decision was rendered. ANALYSIS Country Conditions The RPD found that there had been a drastic change in country conditions in Ethiopia, which was the determinative issue in the claim. The panel noted that a new Prime Minister had been elected and his assumption of office was followed by positive changes in the human rights climate. The government removed political movements from the terrorist list; passed an amnesty proclamation; and invited opposition leaders to return to the country and participate in reform efforts. The RPD noted that the Tigray party had been responsible for abuses against the Oromo people for many years and that many Tigrayans may fear that the roles would be reversed. The RPD found however that the documentary evidence indicated that the Prime Minister seeks to end human rights abuses and had appointed an Amhara person as his new military Chief of Staff. The RPD noted that the Prime Minister had prosecuted officials accused of gross human rights abuses and that it has been said that the crackdown on corruption had an anti-Tigrayan bias. The RPD additionally considered the documentation noting that some Tigrayans fear that the powershift leaves them more vulnerable, exposed, and isolated from fellow Ethiopians. The RPD found that there was insufficient evidence to find on a balance of probabilities that all Tigrayans in Ethiopia face a risk of persecution because of their ethnicity alone. The RPD noted that the Principal Appellant had alleged that he faced problems at the hands of the security forces because it was believed he was a supporter of the opposition in North America. The RPD found however that there was no reason to believe he would be harmed by the security forces given that members of the opposition do not face the same problems that they had in the past. In regard to his fear of ethnic violence he faced in the Oromo region, the RPD noted that the Principal Appellant\u2019s business was now closed and that he would be able to find employment or operate another business in a different area. The Appellants argue that the RPD\u2019s assessment of the change of circumstances in Ethiopia is defective and contrary to the evidence. They submit that the RPD erred by relying exclusively on the 2018 US Department of State report to highlight positive changes, and ignored overwhelming evidence contradicting its findings. They submit that the RPD did not properly apply the legal test for assessing a change of circumstance, which is that the change must be of substantial political significance, effective, and durable. They argue that the RPD did not follow this framework of analysis and failed in its duty to conduct a detailed analysis of country conditions to determine whether the change since the Appellants left the country is meaningful, effective and durable. The Appellants submit that the Ethiopian regime remains under the control of the same party and all government institutions remain the same. They submit that the Human Rights Watch Report states that there are indications that the reform process may ultimately be hindered by a lack of independent institutions to carry forward changes. The same document states that many political activists who do not have a high profile, are likely to be detained. They submit that the Danish Immigration Service Report states that only one third of 30,000 political prisoners were released by the new administration, which is not up to its promise of liberating all political prisoners, and that others were still being arrested by the police on political grounds. They submit that the government has continued detaining actual and imputed opponents in government re-education camps where the detainees endure brainwashing. The Appellants submit that the government has failed to prevent ethnically motivated attacks, as in September ethnic violence had displaced approximately 15,000 people from the outskirts of Addis Ababa. They submit that the new evidence they provided reports on ethnically motivated attacks and mob violence that puts lives in danger and drives thousands away from their homes. The evidence notes that many Tigrayans feel marginalized under the Prime Minister and allege that he deliberately scapegoats the Tigrayan elite for the country\u2019s problems. The Appellants argue that the new evidence makes it clear that the change of circumstances in Ethiopia is not durable, substantial, or meaningful enough to lead to the conclusion that their fear of persecution is no longer well-founded. The Appellants argue that the RPD erred by failing to consider the objective country conditions evidence that contradicts its positive assessment of the human rights situation in Ethiopia. They submit that there is a serious possibility that they will face persecution if they return to Ethiopia. I have reviewed the country conditions documentary evidence and I find that the Appellants\u2019 arguments have merit. While I agree with the RPD that many changes have been made by the regime in Ethiopia in regard to the treatment of perceived opponents, I find that the country conditions documentary evidence does not support a finding that these changes have been effective, meaningful and durable, given that arbitrary arrests and killings continue to occur, and that ethnic violence has been escalating on a daily basis in Ethiopia. I note that human rights violations have continued in Ethiopia despite a change in political leadership. These include unlawful or arbitrary killings by security forces, arbitrary arrest and detention, political prisoners, and substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association. It is noted that authorities regularly detained persons arbitrarily, including protesters, journalists, and opposition party members and that there are hundreds of reports of arbitrary arrest by security forces. I have reviewed the most recent National Documentation Package for Ethiopia and find that there is sufficient evidence contained in this compilation of documents to show that substantial human rights violations continue to occur in Ethiopia. The US Department of State report for 2019 states that significant human rights issues included reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings by security forces; citizens killing other citizens based on their ethnicity; arbitrary arrest and detention by security forces; and harsh and life-threatening prison conditions. It is noted in the report that civilian authorities at times did not maintain control over regional security forces and that local police and militias sometimes acted independently and extra-judicially. The Amnesty International Report for 2019 states that numerous journalists and other critics of government continued to face arbitrary arrest, illegal prolonged detention, and unfair trials. The document states that the Army unlawfully killed at least nine protesters, including children. It is noted that hundreds of political opposition members, journalists, and others who were critical of the government faced unfair trials on charges brought under the ATP law. The trials were marked by illegal and prolonged pretrial detention, unreasonable delays, and persistent complaints of torture and other ill-treatment. The Freedom House Report for 2020 notes that Ethiopia remains beset by political factionalism and intercommunal violence, abuses by security forces, and violations of due process. It is stated that many restrictive laws remain in force. I have considered the Appellants\u2019 particular circumstances. The Principal Appellant has alleged that he was detained in Ethiopia because of his perceived political opinion. He has additionally alleged that his business was destroyed, and he was beaten by police because of his ethnicity. The Principal Appellant\u2019s testimony at the hearing was consistent with prior statements and country conditions in Ethiopia. The RPD did not find that there were any credibility concerns regarding the Appellants\u2019 allegations. I have reviewed the Principal Appellant\u2019s testimony and find that he was a credible witness. Given his situation, I find that the Principal Appellant has established that he was a person perceived by the Ethiopian authorities to be politically opposed to the regime. Based on the country conditions documentary evidence, I find that human rights abuses, which include arbitrary detention, torture, and ill-treatment, against individuals critical of the government have continued to occur. I have additionally considered the Appellants\u2019 ethnicity as Tigrayans and note the country conditions documentary evidence relating to ethnic violence and the lack of state protection available. I furthermore take judicial notice of the present situation in Ethiopia which is being reported internationally. Fighting between Ethiopia's military and regional forces from the northern Tigray region has erupted and increasing ethnic-targeted violence, numerous casualties, and violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law have been reported. Given these conditions, I find that there is more than a mere possibility that the Principal Appellant and his family would come to the attention of the authorities and other ethnic groups should they return to Ethiopia and would suffer serious harm because of their ethnicity and perceived political opinion. CONCLUSION I have considered the totality of the findings in this decision and find that there is a serious possibility that the Appellants would be persecuted because of their perceived political opinion and ethnicity should they return to Ethiopia. The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Aklilu Tamrat Tesfa', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 31, 'end': 34}, {'text': 'Nyala Dani Tesfa', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 42, 'end': 45}, {'text': 'Mazaa Nuru Tesfa', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 56, 'end': 59}, {'text': 'Nyala Zuri Tesfa', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 60, 'end': 63}, {'text': 'Zoya Eshe Tesfa', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 65, 'end': 68}, {'text': 'April', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 236, 'end': 237}, {'text': 'establishment', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 263, 'end': 264}, {'text': 'September', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 273, 'end': 274}, {'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 2462, 'end': 2463}, {'text': 'Nyala Dani Tesfa', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 42, 'end': 45}, {'text': 'Mazaa Nuru Tesfa', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 56, 'end': 59}, {'text': 'Zoya Eshe Tesfa', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 65, 'end': 68}, {'text': 'April', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 236, 'end': 237}, {'text': 'September', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 273, 'end': 274}, {'text': 'Aklilu Tamrat Tesfa', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 31, 'end': 34}, {'text': 'Nyala Zuri Tesfa', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 60, 'end': 63}, {'text': 'establishment', 'label': 'CONTEXT', 'start': 263, 'end': 264}]", "label": "accepted"}
{"doc_text": " Date: 20200116 Docket: IMM-4199-19 Citation: 2020 FC 59 Vancouver, British Columbia, January 16, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Barnes BETWEEN: SEIFESLAM DLEIOW Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] This application for judicial review challenges a decision made by the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (Board) by which the Applicant Seifeslam Dleiow, a foreign national, was found to be inadmissible to Canada under paragraph 34(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The determinative issue presented is whether the Board\u2019s interpretation of that provision was reasonable having regard to the nature of Mr. Dleiow\u2019s criminal conduct. [2] The Board carefully examined Mr. Dleiow\u2019s conduct in relation to a former domestic partner identified as KH. The Board concluded that he was unlawfully in her home with intent to commit an indictable offence, had caused damage to a door and had uttered threats. It also noted that he had pleaded guilty to three of four charges that had been laid against him in connection with this event. However, those convictions did not meet the test for serious criminality under the IRPA. [3] The Board also had considerable evidence before it in relation to several domestic assaults by Mr. Dleiow on another woman. That woman testified before the Board but, contrary to her earlier statements made to police and as testified to by Staff Sergeant Jones, she denied any abuse. Notwithstanding this recantation of her statements to police, the Board found reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Dleiow had assaulted and caused injury to the woman on a number of occasions. Because no convictions had been entered in relation to these events, paragraph 36 of the IPRA had no application. In the result, the Minister proceeded to have Mr. Dleiow declared inadmissible under paragraph 34(1)(e). That paragraph states: 34 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on security grounds for 34 (1) Emportent interdiction de territoire pour raison de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 les faits suivants : [\u2026] [\u2026] (e) engaging in acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada; or e) \u00eatre l\u2019auteur de tout acte de violence susceptible de mettre en danger la vie ou la s\u00e9curit\u00e9 d\u2019autrui au Canada; [Emphasis added] [4] The Board found that paragraph 34(1)(e) of the IRPA applies to acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of Canadian residents and does not require any link to national security. The Board\u2019s interpretation of this provision is succinctly summed up at paragraphs 21 and 22 of its decision: [21] Relying on the rationale provided by the IAD in Mason, inadmissibility under paragraph 34(l)(e) does not require that the conduct have a link to national security or the security of Canada, but rather applies to security in the broader sense including ensuring that individual Canadians are secure from acts of violence that would or might endanger their lives or safety. While section 36 of the IRPA creates a class of inadmissibility requiring (for offences in Canada) a conviction, paragraph 34(l)(e) creates a class of inadmissibility for engaging in acts of violence, criminal or not, that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada. Finding that paragraph 34(l)(e) applies to individual acts of violence that would or might endanger the lives or safety of persons in Canada is consistent with the objectives in paragraphs 3(1)(h) and (i) of the IRPA and is not inconsistent with Canadian values. [22] A plain language interpretation of the phrase \u201cacts of violence\u201d suggests that to be described in paragraph 34(l)(e), the permanent resident or foreign national must have engaged in more than one act of violence. [5] At the time the Board rendered its decision, there was very little jurisprudence considering the scope of paragraph 34(1)(e) of the IPRA. The Board did, however, take some guidance from a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) in Canada v Mason, IAD file No. VB8-02097. In that case, the IAD held that this provision does not require that the conduct in question be related to a national security concern. The Board declined to depart from the IAD\u2019s interpretation and held that Mr. Dleiow\u2019s established conduct was sufficiently egregious to support a finding of inadmissibility. [6] The IAD decision in Mason was more recently the subject of judicial review in Mason v. Canada, 2019 FC 1251, 311 ACWS (3d) 601,. In that decision, Justice S\u00e9bastien Grammond set aside the IAD\u2019s decision. In a very thorough contextual and purposive analysis, Justice Grammond found that the IAD\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(e) was unreasonable because the provision did not apply to criminal conduct that did not involve a national security aspect. In the result, he set aside the IAD\u2019s decision and certified the following question: Is it reasonable to interpret section 34(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, in a manner that does not require proof of conduct that has a nexus with \u201cnational security\u201d or \u201cthe security of Canada?\u201d [7] I understand that the case is now on appeal. [8] Having appropriate regard to the principle of comity, I am required to apply Justice Grammond\u2019s reasoning in Mason, above, unless I am convinced that the decision is distinguishable or manifestly wrong. Examples of manifest error typically include a failure to apply binding authority or relevant legislation or where the judgment is, on its face, ill-considered: see Apotex Inc v Pfizer Inc, 2013 FC 493, [2013] FCJ No 562. [9] The Minister\u2019s Further Memorandum of Argument mentions Justice Grammond\u2019s decision in Mason and notes that it is on appeal. Apart from maintaining the argument that the Board\u2019s decision is reasonable, the Minister did not directly address the issue of comity or identify where Justice Grammond\u2019s decision is legally deficient. In oral argument, counsel for the Minister took issue with Justice Grammond\u2019s analysis on a number of points by raising issues that he addressed and rejected. The fact that arguments may exist for arriving at a different interpretation of paragraph 34(1)(e) does not meet the threshold of manifest error and, in my view, comity applies. [10] For the foregoing reasons, this application is allowed and the Board\u2019s decision is set aside. The matter is to be reconsidered on the merits by a different decision-maker. [11] The Minister is appropriately seeking the certification of the same question that was presented in Mason, above, and the Applicant agrees. In the result, I will certify that question. JUDGMENT in IMM-4199-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that this application is allowed with the matter to be redetermined on the merits by a different decision-maker. THIS COURT\u2019S FURTHER JUDGMENT is that the following question is certified: Is it reasonable to interpret section 34(1)(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, in a manner that does not require proof of conduct that has a nexus with \u201cnational security\u201d or \u201cthe security of Canada\u201d? \"R.L.

Proceeding [1] This application is for judicial review of a decision of a Senior Immigration Officer [the Officer] dated December 14, 2017 [the Decision], in which the Officer reached a negative decision on the Applicant\u2019s Pre-Removal Risk Assessment [PRRA] based on the finding that he was not at personalized risk under section 97 of the IRPA in Iraq due to his Christianity [the Decision]. This application was brought pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA]. II. Background [2] The Applicant is a 31-year-old male citizen of Iraq. His claim of section 97 risk in his PRRA application was based in part on fear due to his profile as a practising Christian in Iraq. [3] On May 9, 2006, the Applicant arrived in Canada with his family. They were granted permanent residence in Canada through his father\u2019s successful application to the Federal Skilled Worker Class. [4] On December 14, 2011, however, the Applicant was convicted of robbery, disguise with intent, and failing to comply with a probation order. [5] On July 18, 2012, CBSA alleged that the Applicant was inadmissible to Canada for serious criminality under section 36(1)(a) of the IRPA. Following an admissibility hearing, the Applicant was found inadmissible, and a deportation order was issued on December 3, 2012. [6] The Applicant\u2019s PRRA application which was based solely on section 97 of the IRPA began in April 2017 and the negative Decision dated December 14, 2017 is the decision under review. III. Decision [7] The only dispositive issue is whether the PRRA Officer failed to disclose extrinsic evidence on which he or she relied. [8] The Decision makes the following two comments about the sources. The first is found on page 3 of the Decision and it reads: I have also considered country documentation, legislation and jurisprudence obtained through independent research. [9] As well, at the end of the Decision, on page 5 under the heading \u201cSources Consulted\u201d the Officer says: Sources were also cited throughout the text of my notes. Note the sources used were all publicly available on the Internet using Google and employing standard search terms. And then below this heading, the only document listed is the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom Annual Report of 2016. [10] The Respondent submits that a review of the Decision shows that the two sources cited were the document just mentioned and one Federal Court case. All the other documents mentioned were provided by counsel for the Applicant. I am persuaded that there is no indication in the Decision that the Officer relied on any other documents. IV. Conclusion [11] In my view, it is mere speculation on the Applicant\u2019s part that documents which post dated his PRRA submissions were relied on by the Officer. Accordingly, an order will be made dismissing this application for judicial review. V. Certification [12] No question was posed for certification for appeal. JUDGMENT IN IMM-2105-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that the application for judicial review is dismissed. \"Sandra J.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200123 Docket: IMM-2335-19 Citation: 2020 FC 83 Ottawa, Ontario, January 23, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Roy BETWEEN: MUHAMMAD KALEEM ULLAH, NABEELA YASMEEN, MUSA KALEEM, MUHAMMAD ABDULLAH, EISA ROOH ULLAH, FATIMA ZAHRA Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] In this judicial review application made pursuant to section 72 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c 27 [IRPA], the decision maker, the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), dismissed the appeal of the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). The applicants are all nationals of Pakistan and they sought protection as refugees. I. The facts [2] The facts of this case are anything but straightforward, if only because the principal applicant has presented a narrative which, over time, evolved considerably. Such \u201cevolution\u201d must be detailed. [3] The evidence in this case starts with a \u201cFirst Information Report regarding cognisable offence reported to the police under section 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code\u201d. This appears to constitute the complaint that was made to the police in Pakistan, following a tragic incident involving the principal applicant; it is alleged to have occurred on August 8, 2012. [4] According to the complaint, the principal applicant sent one of his employees to pick up a cheque from someone by the name of Qaiser Butt. Both the principal applicant and Mr. Butt were operating clothing shops at a market. Mr. Butt, according to the complaint, beat up the employee and verbally abused him. Obviously, he never delivered the cheque. Upon the report made by the employee to his boss, the principal applicant went to confront Mr. Butt at his shop. Mr. Butt threatened the principal applicant with \u201cconsequences\u201d. The principal applicant returned to his shop but, a short time later, Mr. Butt and a number of other men carrying firearms arrived and they immediately began shooting at the people then in the applicant\u2019s shop. One of the persons present was killed and five others, including the applicant, were injured. Indeed, the applicant required hospitalization in Lahore as he was hit in the hip joint. The complaint speaks of \u201c(t)he reasons of animosity was financial transaction\u201d (RAD decision, para 10). The same complaint speaks of \u201c(t)he aggressors have caused fear and terror among the masses by resorting to indiscriminate shooting at the bazaar\u201d (RAD decision, para 10). The complaint was made on the day of the shooting incident by the principal applicant\u2019s brother. [5] The description of the incident changed when presented in the Basis of Claim (BOC) made in Vancouver on November 21, 2016. That was just a few days after the applicant and his family crossed the border into British Columbia, after having spent the preceding months following their arrival from Pakistan, on December 26, 2015, in the United States. In fact, according to the BOC, the applicants spent those months in New York, except for a short trip to Buffalo for \u201ctwo weeks\u201d where, it appears, they hoped to cross the border into Canada. Instead, eleven months later, the family travelled to Seattle by plane in order to come to Canada. There is no explanation for that state of affairs. [6] The BOC offers a significantly different narrative of the incident of August 8, 2012. This time, the principal applicant states that his \u201cproblem was I was western dress designer\u201d (Certified Tribunal Record (CTR), p. 103). More specifically, the principal applicant claims that he was designing ladies\u2019 clothes. He says that \u201c(t)here [sic] issue with me was I don\u2019t make cultural clothes but rather design and make western clothes due to which women are not wearing traditional dresses and I am spreading vulgarity\u201d (CTR, p. 103). Furthermore, the principal applicant claims that he was faulted for not paying donations to Lashkar Taib. In this narrative, the shooting incident is described as ten terrorists starting to open fire, which resulted in the death of one of the applicant\u2019s customers. The principal applicant states that there was no reason for attacking him. In the BOC, the principal applicant says that he did report the attack to the police, as opposed to the complaint having been made by the applicant\u2019s brother. For the principal applicant, it is the First Information Report (FIR), which will get the terrorists to \u201ctake any step to kill me and my family\u201d (CTR, p. 104). He says that he changed residence and changed school for his four children. Indeed, he claims that there have been two more shooting incidents, one on February 6, 2015, near Islamabad where someone pointed a firearm at his son. He was not injured. Then, on September 15, 2015, two persons on a motorcycle shot at the car he was in, together with one of his brothers. He did not complain to the police with respect to that incident. [7] The evolution of the storyline was not complete. An amended BOC narrative was done on January 12, 2017. This time, the narrative begins in early August 2012. It is alleged that members of Jamaat ul Dawa with Qaisar Butt approached him at his shop and asked for a donation of half a million rupees. The donation was meant to be obligatory, yet the principal applicant refused to donate any money. As a result, these persons were upset and stormed out of the shop. The principal applicant declares that Qaisar Butt is a member of Jamaat ul Dawa. The amended BOC narrative then says that \u201c(s)everal days later I received a call from someone identifying himself as Lashker-e-Tayyaba\u201d who complained that \u201cI was designing vulgar dresses for women and facilitating immorality among them\u201d. He was said to be an agent of the West who promoted vulgarity and destroyed the culture which was an open war against the religion of Islam (Amended BOC narrative, para 5). [8] It is only at paragraph 6 that reference is made to the tragic incident of August 8, 2012. However, the story is not the same. It is said this time that \u201cone of my employees was on his way to the bank to deposit cheques in our business account when he was accosted by Qaisar Butt\u201d (Amended BOC narrative, para 6). The difficulty is that the original First Information Report was speaking in terms of an employee of the principal applicant going to Qaisar Butt\u2019s shop in order to retrieve a cheque. In the amended BOC narrative, cheques were to be deposited at a bank and the cheques were stolen by Butt. While the First Information Report spoke of the principal applicant going to Butt\u2019s shop to confront him, the amended BOC narrative sends one of the principal applicant\u2019s brother (Naeem) and several shop owners to confront Butt at his shop who is said to have been very rude towards them. An hour later, Butt, together with members of the Jamaat ul Dawa attacked the shop. [9] That is not all; at paragraph 8 of the amended BOC narrative, the principal applicant declares that he was operated on at a hospital in Lahore. Several months later he had to be operated again as he was experiencing excruciating pain. He declares that \u201cI remained bed ridden for two years and was not able to work\u201d. [10] The principal applicant reports that he started receiving threatening phone calls, including calls where he was ordered to withdraw the FIR or else be killed (Amended BOC narrative, para 9). The same callers demanded that he renounce designing western-style women\u2019s clothing and make donations for that organisation. He claimed that he was warned that his children would be kidnapped. While he would have been bedridden for two years starting around the fall of 2012, the principal applicant states that he and his family relocated again to Rahwali in November 2013. The decision was made, he says, to wind up his business, which had been flourishing. In early 2014, he received another phone call asking for a donation of one million rupees to Jamaat ul Dawa. That made the bedridden principal applicant to relocate again to a different neighborhood in April 2014. In December 2014, the principal applicant sold his second business outlet (he had originally three outlets). He relocated again his family, this time to the city of Murree. [11] The attempt at shooting at his son on February 6, 2015 is somewhat elaborated on in the amended BOC narrative. The reader learns that as they were out to look for rentals in Murree, a \u201cbearded armed man approached us. He shot at my son Musa but my son miraculously escaped harm\u201d (Amended BOC narrative, para 13). As a result, the family relocated in Wazirabad. That is where, on September 15, 2015, \u201ctwo bearded men on a bike\u201d who were following the applicant and his brother came close by and they started shooting at the car, smashing the window. [12] As can be readily seen, the narrative evolved and evolved quite significantly. In fact, it evolved one last time when the principal applicant submitted a second amended BOC narrative adding a paragraph 17 to the 16 paragraphs of the first BOC narrative. That paragraph reads as follows: 17. In January of 2016 my brother Naeem started receiving anonymous threatening calls warning him to withdraw the FIR that he had lodged on my behalf in August of 2012 and asking about my whereabouts. He continued to receive such threats forcing him to change his residence twice, once in 2015 and once in 2016. He went to the police for help and was ultimately advised by letter from the police to install a gate in front of his business (which is the last remaining outlet of German Suitors) and to get his own gun for personal safety. It is somewhat surprising that Naeem would have been forced to change his residence twice, once in 2015 and once in 2016 because of a phone call that came in 2016. At any rate, it does not appear that the applicant\u2019s other brother who is operating the store with Naeem ever had to relocate and, indeed, the brothers have continued to operate the store without, seemingly, any particular difficulty. I note that there is on this record no direct evidence coming from Naeem or anyone else. They are referred to by the applicant. II. RAD decision [13] The RAD declared that the determinative issue in this appeal is the Internal Flight Alternative (IFA), which exists in this case in Pakistan. There were two issues examined by the RPD. First, it considered that the claim was not credible. The story having evolved over three narratives, the RPD was very much concerned by the allegation that the trouble the principal applicant ran into was because he was a western dress designer. The panel considered that \u201c(t)he questions that arise from this allegation are two-fold: why would the principal claimant have this problem when literally hundreds of other fashion designers in Pakistan clearly do not; and, secondly, why are the claimant\u2019s brothers still able to operate their store openly, when the principal claimant could not?\u201d (RPD decision, para 21). As for the refusal to make donations, the RPD noted the evolution from the original BOC narrative where the refusal to pay a donation was barely mentioned. The RPD did not even mention that the original First Information Report did not even allude to a refusal to make a donation or, for that matter, the designer issue, only to state that \u201c(t)he reason of animosity was financial transaction\u201d. Indeed, the RPD notes that the emphasis changed again in the two amended BOC narratives to focus on the refusal to make donations. In the end, the RPD found the claim to be defective because of the lack of credibility and concluded that there was an IFA in Pakistan. [14] It is in that context that the RAD rendered its decision and stated that the determinative issue is the IFA. The parties agree, and the Court concurs, that whether what is considered is the credibility of the claim or the availability of an IFA, the standard of review shall be reasonableness. Accordingly, it is the applicants\u2019 burden to establish through a balance of probabilities that the decision on the IFA is not reasonable as the decision is not justified and the process of articulating the reasons does not provide justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision making process. [15] The RAD identified the two prong test that must be applied in assessing an IFA. One prong is concerned with the safety of the area where the claimant could find a flight alternative, while the other deals with the conditions in that part of the country that would make the alternative unreasonable. Recently, our Court encapsulated the test in the following fashion in Photskhverashvili v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 CF 415 at paragraph 29: [29] To find an IFA, the RAD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that: (1) there is no serious possibility of an appellant being persecuted in the IFA; and (2) in all the circumstances - including circumstances particular to an appellant - conditions in the IFA are such that it would not be unreasonable to seek refuge there (Rasaratnam v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration) (1991), [1992] 1 FC 706 at paras 5 and 6). It has been found by the Federal Court of Appeal in Ranganathan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2001] 2 FC 164 [Ranganathan], examining one of its prior decisions in Thirunavukkarasu v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] 1 FC 589 [Thirunavukkarasu], that there is a high threshold required concerning the second prong of the test: [15] We read the decision of Linden J.A. for this Court as setting up a very high threshold for the unreasonableness test. It requires nothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area. In addition, it requires actual and concrete evidence of such conditions. The absence of relatives in a safe place, whether taken alone or in conjunction with other factors, can only amount to such condition if it meets that threshold, that is to say if it establishes that, as a result, a claimant's life or safety would be jeopardized. This is in sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life, loss of aspirations, loss of beloved ones and frustration of one's wishes and expectations. [My emphasis.] The Federal Court of Appeal specifically declined to lower the standard. [16] For the RAD, whether this constitutes a dispute with a local businessman or there is some risk from terrorist groups, the result is the same. An internal relocation is possible in Pakistan. For so doing, the RAD relies on country documentation from the United Kingdom Home Office where the point is made about the size and the diversity of the population found in Pakistan, such that there are viable relocation options for a member of most ethnic and religious minorities. [17] The RAD addressed squarely the principal appellant\u2019s contention that it would not be safe for the applicants to return to any location in Pakistan, on the basis that the particular group allegedly involved in the persecution has a very strong network, having the ability to find anyone in Pakistan. For its part, \u201c(t)he RAD \ufb01nds the Appellant\u2019s testimony about the agent of persecution\u2019s ability to track him down was vague and lacking in speci\ufb01city\u201d (RAD decision, para 32). Further, at paragraph 34, one reads: \u201c(t)he RAD \ufb01nds it reasonable to expect that, if an individual or organization was of suf\ufb01cient strength and reach to be able to learn of a person\u2019s return to Pakistan or their presence in any city in Pakistan, there would be objective country condition evidence to support this\u201d. No such documentary evidence was submitted by the applicants and the available documentary evidence does not establish that there is the geographic reach capability to trace these applicants in a country like Pakistan. [18] The RAD quotes at length from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the conditions in Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi. It concludes that \u201cthere is not a serious possibility that the Appellant [the applicant before the Court] would face persecution at the hands of the agents of persecution in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad\u201d (RAD decision, para 38). [19] As for the second prong, it is said at paragraph 40 of the decision that \u201c(t)he only issue advanced against relocation within the Appellants\u2019 country is that they are targets of an individual associated with extremist groups and that they will \ufb01nd him anywhere in Pakistan. The RAD has previously concluded the agent of persecution does not have that ability\u201d. [20] Whether the claim is credible or not becomes a red herring once it has been determined that a flight alternative exists in Pakistan. Nevertheless, the RAD spent some time examining the credibility of the claim. Thus, the RAD noted that the FIR did not mention any association with terrorism or an agent of persecution or that extortion for the benefit of a terrorist organization was at the heart of the tragic incident of August 8, 2012. [21] With respect to another shooting incident, what was referred to as a police report by counsel at the hearing of this case is in fact a letter concerning the shooting incident of September 15, 2015 by the principal applicant\u2019s brother. It is unclear whether it was ever sent to, or received by, the police authorities. As with the FIR, little weight is put on this letter. Finally, the RAD finds that there is evidence that the two brothers who are operating the remaining store are still able to live and conduct business in Pakistan. III. Arguments and analysis [22] As already noted, the standard of review in this case is reasonableness. In my view, the applicants have failed to show that the conclusion reached by the RAD (and also the RPD), and how it was reached, that there exists an IFA in some of the large cities in Pakistan is not reasonable. [23] It seems to me that it is often too easily forgotten what the rationale is for the IFA. In Rasaratnam v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 FC 706, the Federal Court of Appeal reminded what the origin of the concept is: \u2026 since by definition a Convention refugee must be a refugee from a country, not from some subdivision or region of a country, a claimant cannot be a Convention refugee if there is an IFA. It follows that the determination of whether or not there is an IFA is integral to the determination whether or not a claimant is a Convention refugee. I see no justification for departing from the norms established by the legislation and jurisprudence and treating an IFA question as though it were a cessation of or exclusion from Convention refugee status. (p. 710) Basically, before seeking refuge abroad, one must seek an alternative in one\u2019s country of origin (Thirunavukkarasu, supra, p. 599). The claimant must show, on a balance of probabilities, that she is a refugee, which includes that there is a serious possibility of persecution in the area which is alleged to afford an alternative. [24] The words of Linden J.A. in Thirunavukkarasu, supra, in 1994, were specifically endorsed in Ranganathan, supra. They serve as a reminder of what is expected from a claimant: Thus, IFA must be sought, if it is not unreasonable to do so, in the circumstances of the individual claimant. This test is a flexible one, that takes into account the particular situation of the claimant and the particular country involved. This is an objective test and the onus of proof rests on the claimant on this issue, just as it does with all the other aspects of a refugee claim. Consequently, if there is a safe haven for claimants in their own country, where they would be free of persecution, they are expected to avail themselves of it unless they can show that it is objectively unreasonable for them to do so. Let me elaborate. It is not a question of whether in normal times the refugee claimant would, on balance, choose to move to a different, safer part of the country after balancing the pros and cons of such a move to see if it is reasonable. Nor is it a matter of whether the other, safer part of the country is more or less appealing to the claimant than a new country. Rather, the question is whether, given the persecution in the claimant's part of the country, it is objectively reasonable to expect him or her to seek safety in a different part of that country before seeking a haven in Canada or elsewhere. Stated another way for clarity, the question to be answered is, would it be unduly harsh to expect this person, who is being persecuted in one part of his country, to move to another less hostile part of the country before seeking refugee status abroad? An IFA cannot be speculative or theoretical only; it must be a realistic, attainable option. Essentially, this means that the alternative place of safety must be realistically accessible to the claimant. Any barriers to getting there should be reasonably surmountable. The claimant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or to undergo undue hardship in travelling there or in staying there. For example, claimants should not be required to cross battle lines where fighting is going on at great risk to their lives in order to reach a place of safety. Similarly, claimants should not be compelled to hide out in an isolated region of their country, like a cave in the mountains, or in a desert or a jungle, if those are the only areas of internal safety available. But neither is it enough for refugee claimants to say that they do not like the weather in a safe area, or that they have no friends or relatives there, or that they may not be able to find suitable work there. If it is objectively reasonable in these latter cases to live in these places, without fear of persecution, then IFA exists and the claimant is not a refugee. In conclusion, it is not a matter of a claimant\u2019s convenience or the attractiveness of the IFA, but whether one should be expected to make do in that location, before travelling half-way around the world to seek a safe haven, in another country. Thus, the objective standard of reasonableness which I have suggested for an IFA is the one that best conforms to the definition of Convention refugee. That definition requires claimants to be unable or unwilling by reason of fear of persecution to claim the protection of their home country in any part of that country. The prerequisites of that definition can only be met if it is not reasonable for the claimant to seek and obtain safety from persecution elsewhere in the country. (pages 597-598-599) [My emphasis.] [25] In Kanthasamy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, 2015 SCR 909, the Supreme Court commented that relief on humanitarian and compassionate grounds is not intended to be an alternative immigration scheme. The same can be said of the refugee protection which is offered. A person who has an IFA is not a refugee and the preference for staying in Canada does not suffice. [26] The case for the applicants never rises beyond a disagreement with the RAD about evidence offered by the principal applicant. I have reviewed the transcript of the hearing before the RPD on February 15, 2018. While the principal applicant relies on his more detailed testimony, that testimony was less than enlightening. Indeed, the evolution of the story, which started with the FIR, continued before the RPD. [27] Contrary to what was contended by the applicants, the RAD followed, in my view, scrupulously the test for establishing an IFA. The principal applicant never discharged his burden of establishing that he is a refugee. [28] The applicants claimed that the RAD expected that was to be established \u201chow someone would be able to locate him among millions of people in Pakistan\u201d, as if this were a higher threshold than what could be reasonable, where it referred, at paragraph 31, to the contention that the applicant could not be safe anywhere in Pakistan because he could be tracked down. When read in context, that is not the construction that can be put on those words. In support of his argument that he could be tracked down, the applicant suggested before the RPD that someone attacked him while he was looking for a home to rent, away from where he had lived previously (in Muree, near Islamabad). Paragraph 31 of the RAD decision dealt in its first half with how the applicant knew that the person who tried to attack his son was a terrorist, the \u201cbearded men\u201d; the applicant had only to offer that that person was bearded and had long clothes. Then, the RPD added that \u201c(w)hen asked if he could provide any additional evidence on this issue or how someone would be able to locate him among millions of people in Pakistan, the Appellant replied that he did not know\u201d. This does not constitute a requirement of higher standard. It is merely a quip by the RPD: how can it be reasonably argued that the applicant can be located among millions of Pakistanis? It refers rather to the population of cities like Karachi, Lahore or Islamabad; it is a way of expressing that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in cities like these three. The RAD took issue with the vagueness of the testimony and its lack of specificity (RAD decision, para 32) about how he could be tracked down. [29] Fundamentally, the applicants suggest that a standard of certainty of persecution is imported by the RAD in its decision. On the contrary, the RAD concluded that the principal applicant\u2019s testimony about the ability to track him down was vague and lacking in specificity. The applicant\u2019s contention boiled down to saying, simply, that \u201c(t)hey have very strong network, they have that ability to find me. Nothing in Pakistan is hidden from them\u201d (RAD decision, para 32). It can hardly be argued that not being satisfied with that evidence is setting a standard of certainty of persecution. [30] The IFA being the determinative issue, the judicial review application must be dismissed. But there is more. The issues raised by the applicants concerning the credibility of the claim are red herrings. There was, in my view, ample evidence to conclude this claim lacks credibility. From the FIR to the first BOC and the amended BOC narratives, to the testimony of the principal applicant before the RPD, there was such an evolution in the story that it became impossible to know what the true story is. The FIR is about a financial transaction. It is only much later that it is portrayed as being attempts by terrorists to extort money from the principal applicant. The credibility of this claim was from the very beginning an issue. There was nothing new with the difficulty of understanding the applicant\u2019s story by the time it reached the RAD. In fact, the RPD noted specifically that the \u201cprincipal claimant\u2019s story evolved over his three narratives\u201d (RPD decision, para 21). [31] It is quite clear that the RPD did not believe the story as told because, largely, the story \u201cevolves\u201d so much. The RAD did not disagree. I fail to see how the RAD was misguided. [32] The applicant submits that the reference by the RAD to the FIR constitutes a violation of procedural fairness as the document has not been referred to by the RPD. The claim is that the applicant ought to have been allowed to make submissions. I do not share this point of view. [33] As was found by the RPD, the principal applicant\u2019s narrative evolved considerably over time. That, in and of itself, is problematic when credibility is an issue, as was declared to be the case early on. As the Court points out in Koffi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 4, the RAD did not ignore contradictory evidence on the record and make additional findings on issues unknown to the applicant (para 38). In fact, the \u201cevolution\u201d appeared on the face of the FIR which was in evidence. There was nothing new. It was well known that credibility was at the heart of this case, together with the IFA. In effect, there was no new question and new argument raised (Ching v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 725) which would require that be allowed some submission. As in Sary v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 178, the FIR is nothing more than \u201canother piece of evidence in the tribunal's file which supported the RPD's findings on Mr. Sary\u2019s lack of credibility\u2026 This is not a situation where the decision maker considered extrinsic evidence without giving Mr. Sary the opportunity to review it. On the contrary, Mr. Sary\u2019s credibility constituted the very basis of the RPD\u2019s decision and the appeal filed by Mr. Sary\u201d (para 30). That applies equally in this case. [34] In this case, the applicants themselves referred to the FIR in their submissions before the RAD. It is said at paragraph 6 of the factum before the RAD that \u201c(t)he incident [of August 8, 2012] was reported to the police and an FIR was lodged but nothing ever came of it\u201d (para 6). The story reported in the preceding paragraphs of the factum did not correspond to the narrative in the FIR. It is a bit rich to then argue that \u201c(t)he RPD\u2019s credibility assessment was extremely brief and superficial\u201d (factum before the RAD, para 17). In fact, the applicants argue that the FIR constituted corroborative evidence (factum before the RAD, para 31). The RAD merely noted that the FIR did not refer to the incident as being in association with terrorist related activities, the very issue put into play by the applicants in their factum before it. There is no new question or new argument. The RAD did not raise questions that were not advanced by the applicants, but merely addresses issues brought up by the applicants (Kwakwa v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 600). There was no violation of the principles of procedural fairness. [35] The same must be said of a \u201cpolice report\u201d concerning the alleged attack of September 15, 2015. As I understand it, the argument is that the RAD assessed the authenticity of the \u201cpolice report\u201d without raising the issue with the applicants. The trouble with the argument is that its premise is not established. All that the RAD found is that counsel for the applicants, at the hearing before the RPD, referred to the said document as being a FIR, which it cannot be, to, then, later, describe it as a \u201cpolice report\u201d. On its face, the document cannot be a \u201cpolice report\u201d as it takes the form of a letter from someone who identifies himself as the principal applicant\u2019s brother and who reports on the September 15 incident. The RAD finds that this is not a \u201cpolice report\u201d, but rather a simple letter about which there is no documentation to indicate that it was even received. The RAD concludes that there is little weight that can be attributed to the document. This goes to the sufficiency of the evidence; there was no violation of a principle of procedural fairness (Farooq v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 164; Procedural Fairness Where Credibility is an Issue, by Steven Meurrens, meurrensonimmigration.com). [36] The other arguments raised by the applicants are also without merit. They are no more than a disagreement with the assessment made by the RAD (the principal applicant\u2019s brothers who have continued to operate the store) and the reasons being allegedly defective. They are not. When read in light of the record, they amply allow the reviewing court to understand the basis of the decision. [37] The Supreme Court has on more than one occasion agreed with this passage taken from Komolafe v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 431: [11] Newfoundland Nurses is not an open invitation to the Court to provide reasons that were not given, nor is it licence to guess what findings might have been made or to speculate as to what the tribunal might have been thinking. This is particularly so where the reasons are silent on a critical issue. It is ironic that Newfoundland Nurses, a case which at its core is about deference and standard of review, is urged as authority for the supervisory court to do the task that the decision maker did not do, to supply the reasons that might have been given and make findings of fact that were not made. This is to turn the jurisprudence on its head. Newfoundland Nurses allows reviewing courts to connect the dots on the page where the lines, and the direction they are headed, may be readily drawn. Here, there were no dots on the page. [My emphasis.] It was referred to in Williams Lake Indian Band v Canada (Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development), 2018 SCC 4, [2018] 1 SCR 83 at paragraph 154. Similarly, the same paragraph was quoted at length in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, at paragraph 97. The reasons in this case are much more than dots on a page. For those who disagree with reasons, they will always be deficient. I have not been convinced that there is any deficiency of any magnitude in this case. [38] To the extent the existence of an IFA exists, as found by the RAD, this constitutes the complete disposition concerning the reasonableness of the claim. There is no need to consider the credibility of the claim, but the finding concerning the credibility of the claim is amply supported and is therefore reasonable. As for transgressions of procedural fairness, the allegations concerning errors by the RAD have not been made out; they are no more than a disagreement with the findings of the RAD dressed up as some failure to engage in a dialogue. It is worth repeating: the determinative issue was the presence of an alternative location in Pakistan where the principal applicant would feel safe. [39] The parties are in agreement that there is no question to be certified in accordance with section 74 of IRPA.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200103 Docket: IMM-6486-18 Citation: 2020 FC 12 Ottawa, Ontario, January 3, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice Norris BETWEEN: YOUSSEF SOULTANI KANAWATI MAYSAA SAAD MALAKE SULTANI KANAWATI YAACOUB SOULTANI KANAWATI ROLA SULTANI KANAWATI Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] The applicants are citizens of Lebanon. They sought refugee protection in Canada on the basis of their fear of persecution by members the Saraya Resistance, a faction of Hezbollah that is active in Lebanon. [2] The principal applicant, Youssef Soultani Kanawati, claims that in April 2016 he was approached by Bilal Akar, a well-known member of the group, who encouraged him to join the group. Mr. Kanawati declined. Bilal said he would give him some time to reconsider. A few weeks later, Bilal and his friends approached Mr. Kanawati\u2019s wife on the street and harassed her. When Mr. Kanawati confronted them, Bilal and his friends assaulted him and his wife. Bilal took out a pocket knife and threatened to break Mr. Kanawati\u2019s legs if he reported him to the police. Mr. Kanawati filed a complaint with the police despite the threat. Bilal and his friends approached Mr. Kanawati yet again a few weeks later and, once again, threatened him and his family if he did not join the Saraya Resistance. They also assaulted him again. Mr. Kanawati was taken to the hospital and he reported the incident to the police. He claims that the police also fear the Saraya Resistance and, as a result, they refused to prosecute his assailants. Fearing continued persecution by this group, Mr. Kanawati, his wife and their minor children left Lebanon for Canada. They entered Canada at Pearson International Airport on August 17, 2016, on visitor visas. [3] The applicants submitted an inland claim for refugee protection on October 21, 2016. Their claim was prepared with the assistance of a lawyer (Mr. Kaminker) and an Arabic interpreter. [4] The applicants\u2019 hearing before the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada [IRB] took place on December 6, 2017. The applicants were represented by Mr. Kaminker at that hearing. [5] For reasons dated December 19, 2017, the RPD rejected the claims. The member made negative credibility findings against the applicants on the basis of material differences between the original narrative provided by Mr. Kanawati in support of the claim and his testimony at the hearing. In short: \u201cThe testimony regarding Bilal and his actions against the claimants is not credible.\u201d The RPD member acknowledged that the applicants had provided a copy of a police report to corroborate their allegations. However, since the report relied entirely on information provided by Mr. Kanawati, the member gave it no weight because Mr. Kanawati had been found not to be credible with respect to key aspects of his allegations. [6] Representing themselves, the applicants appealed this decision to the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] of the IRB. In a decision dated November 28, 2018, the RAD dismissed the appeal and confirmed the RPD\u2019s determination that the applicants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. [7] The applicants then retained Mr. Kaminker again and brought this application for judicial review of the RAD\u2019s decision under section 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. [8] For the reasons that follow, the application will be dismissed. [9] It is well-established that the substance of the RAD\u2019s decision is reviewed on a reasonableness standard (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93 at para 35). That this is the appropriate standard is reinforced by Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov], where the majority of the Court set out a revised framework for determining the standard of review with respect to the merits of an administrative decision (at para 10). Applying Vavilov, there is no basis for derogating from the presumption that reasonableness is the applicable standard of review of the RAD\u2019s decision. [10] The majority in Vavilov also sought to clarify the proper application of the reasonableness standard (at para 143). The principles the majority emphasizes were drawn in large measure from prior jurisprudence, including Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, 2008 SCC 9. Even though the present application was argued prior to the release of Vavilov, the footing upon which the parties advanced their respective positions concerning the reasonableness of the RAD\u2019s decision is consistent with these principles. [11] As discussed in Vavilov, the exercise of public power \u201cmust be justified, intelligible and transparent, not in the abstract but to the individuals subject to it\u201d (Vavilov at para 95). For this reason, an administrative decision maker has a responsibility \u201cto justify to the affected party, in a manner that is transparent and intelligible, the basis on which it arrived at a particular conclusion\u201d (Vavilov at para 96). A reasonable decision \u201cis one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d (Vavilov at para 85). The onus is on the applicants to demonstrate that the RAD\u2019s decision is unreasonable. Before a decision can be set aside on this basis, the reviewing court must be satisfied that \u201cthere are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency\u201d (Vavilov at para 100). [12] The applicants contend that it was unreasonable for the RAD to uphold the RPD\u2019s negative credibility findings and to fail to consider the potentially corroborative documents (i.e. police and medical reports). I do not agree in either respect. [13] As the majority emphasized in Vavilov, a reviewing court must \u201cread the decision maker\u2019s reasons in light of the history and context of the proceedings in which they were rendered\u201d (at para 94). In the present case, a crucial part of the context of the RAD\u2019s decision is how the applicants framed their appeal. [14] In a letter from Mr. Kanawati to the RAD dated February 22, 2018, in effect the applicants raised three related errors by the RPD: first, the differences between the original narrative and the testimony before the RPD were not material; second, Mr. Kanawati stated that he was under a lot of stress and very nervous when he provided the information for the original narrative; and third, he was \u201cperhaps, wrongly advised, to be as brief & to the point in my application as possible.\u201d While not exactly a ground of appeal, Mr. Kanawati also claimed in his letter that the tactics of the Saraya Resistance, including the use of spies, are well known. [15] The errors alleged by the applicants were reiterated in substance and without further elaboration in the Applicants\u2019 Memorandum to the RAD prepared pursuant to the requirements of Rule 3(3)(g) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules, SOR/2012-257. [16] The RAD member rejected these grounds of appeal. The member confirmed that she had reviewed the record in its entirety. She found the omissions in Mr. Kanawati\u2019s narrative were central to the claim and warranted the negative credibility findings, especially considering that the applicants had had the assistance of able and experienced counsel when preparing the Basis of Claim [BOC]. The member also noted that Mr. Kanawati did not raise the issue of stress or anxiety at the RPD hearing and provided no medical evidence of an impairment that would have prevented him from completing his BOC properly. She noted that it was insufficient simply to claim that \u201ceveryone knows\u201d that the Saraya Resistance relies on a network of spies. [17] Further, the member noted that the applicants had failed to identify clearly who allegedly gave them incorrect advice in the preparation of their BOC. As well, \u201c[w]hether it was the translator or legal counsel, no notice was provided in either case to allow them to respond to the allegations of professional incompetence.\u201d The member therefore concluded that \u201cthere is insufficient evidence to support the Appellants\u2019 speculation that \u2018perhaps\u2019 they were given wrong advice.\u201d [18] The applicants have failed to demonstrate that these determinations are unreasonable. The importance of providing a complete account in a BOC has been emphasized many times. As Justice McDonald stated recently in Ogaulu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 547 [Ogaulu], this Court \u201chas confirmed on numerous occasions that all the important facts and details of a claim must be included, and failing to do so can affect the credibility of all or part of a claimant\u2019s testimony\u201d (at para 18). When a BOC omits significant or material details, such omissions can form a reasonable basis for doubting a claimant\u2019s credibility (Ogaulu at para 20; Jele v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2017 FC 24 at para 50). [19] In the present case, the RAD upheld the RPD\u2019s determination that Mr. Kanawati had omitted material information from his BOC and that this had an adverse impact on his credibility. This conclusion is altogether reasonable. For example, while Mr. Kanawati stated in his BOC that he worked as a plumber and that his job \u201cexposes him to many people,\u201d he failed to mention that he often worked for high placed civilian and military officials in Lebanon and that this was why Bilal was specifically trying to recruit him as a spy (as he claimed at the hearing). The RPD member stated: \u201c[i]f it were true that it [being a plumber] exposed him to government officials, it is reasonable to expect this would have been mentioned.\u201d The RPD member concluded that Mr. Kanawati had \u201cadded this detail at his hearing to bolster his testimony.\u201d [20] It was not unreasonable for the RAD member to conclude that the RPD\u2019s findings regarding the omissions from the BOC \u201cwere well-founded and central to the key allegations of the Appellants\u2019 risk of persecution.\u201d There is no basis for me to interfere. [21] Understandably, the applicants do not challenge the RAD\u2019s determination with respect to their allegation that they were ill-advised in the preparation of their BOC. [22] The applicants do, however, contend that it was unreasonable for the RAD not to consider the potentially corroborative documents and whether the RPD had erred in that respect. I do not agree. [23] Once again, the RAD\u2019s decision must be assessed in the context of how the applicants framed their appeal. The applicants did not raise any alleged error in relation to the RPD\u2019s assessment of the police or medical reports. It is well-established that the RAD is not required to consider potential errors that an appellant did not raise: see Dhillon v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 321 at paras 18-20; Ilias v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 661 at para 39; Broni v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 365 at para 15; and Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Chamanpreet Kaur Kaler, 2019 FC 883 at paras 11-13 (IMM-57-19). [24] The RAD member was required to address the specific errors alleged by the applicants (Dahal v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 1102 at para 30). This is exactly what she did. She was not required to go beyond the applicants\u2019 grounds of appeal and consider other potential errors. As a result, it was not unreasonable for her to dispose of the appeal as she did. [25] For these reasons, the application for judicial review will be dismissed. [26] The parties did not suggest any serious questions of general importance for certification under section 74(d) of the IRPA. I agree that none arise. JUDGMENT IN IMM-6486-18 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that The application for judicial review is dismissed.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : MC006571 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW These are my reasons for dismissing this appeal. Prahan Villavarayan (the Appellant) is a citizen of Sri Lanka. He fears the Sri Lankan army because he witnessed his girlfriend\u2019s abduction in 2007 and then recognized one of the abductors in an army base in 2018. After confronting the abductor, the Appellant alleges that he was threatened and detained on multiple occasions by the army before fleeing the country. He travelled to Canada via the United States and claimed refugee status. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected his claim for the following main reasons: He inconsistently described the identity and number of abductors and his name is mentioned nowhere on the human rights complaint describing this abduction; He acted inconsistently by boldly confronting his girlfriend\u2019s abductor in a public setting, yet hiding what happened from his family members ; He was evasive in describing whether or not his girlfriend complained to a human rights organization and whether that organization spoke to the officer he recognized; He made no efforts to find out what transpired after he left the country; The letters he provided in support of his claim contain important contradictions; The discrimination he would face as a young Tamil male does not amount to persecution; His failure to pursue a refugee claim in the United States was not reasonably explained and is inconsistent with his alleged fear. The Appellant has appealed this decision and now asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to recognize him as a person in need of protection or a Convention Refugee. In the alternative, he asks that this matter be remitted to the RPD for redetermination. He has not submitted any new evidence, nor does he request an oral hearing. He makes the following main arguments: Just because his name is not on the human rights complaint does not mean he did not witness the abduction; He reasonably explained why he did not tell his family members about recognizing one of the abductors and why he described a different number of abductors than what is listed in the complaint; The contradictions in his lawyer\u2019s letter are explained by the fact that his wife obtained the letter; The RPD failed to consider the risks faced by young Tamils who return to Sri Lanka after failed refugee claims and failed to do a section 97 analysis. DECISION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee, nor a person in need of protection. ANALYSIS My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. Inconsistent evidence as to why the Appellant was targeted in 2018 In the Appellant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) and testimony, he alleges that he was targeted by the army in 2018 because he confronted one of his girlfriend\u2019s abductors. The Appellant\u2019s lawyer who negotiated his release from custody, however, indicates in his letter that the Appellant was held in custody by the army in 2018 \u201cfor revealing to the authorities including human rights [sic] about the abduction of his girlfriend\u201d. The RPD gave no weight to this letter due to this contradiction as to the reason he was detained. The Appellant argues that this error in the letter is due to the fact that the Appellant\u2019s wife contacted the lawyer for the letter rather than the Appellant obtaining the letter himself. I reject this explanation and find this contradiction to be a major credibility issue. A lawyer who is retained to represent a client to assist in securing his release and arranging a place for him to hide is the person who should know the most about why their client was detained in the first place. The lawyer\u2019s statement that he was detained for revealing the abduction of his girlfriend goes against many of the Appellant\u2019s core allegations. The Appellant has alleged that after his girlfriend\u2019s abduction, he went to various authorities to complain and investigate the situation. His girlfriend\u2019s abduction was no secret. He was then detained in 2018 because supposedly he recognized and confronted one of his girlfriend\u2019s abductors. This confrontation is mentioned no where in this letter. Not only does the Appellant\u2019s own lawyer state the wrong reason for his very own client to be detained, but he also gives a reason that contradicts other important aspects of the evidence. The Appellant explains that this error is due to the fact that his wife procured the letter. I agree with the RPD that this does not explain why the lawyer would make an error relating to a client that he himself is representing. He would have his own independent knowledge of this case if he was retained as the Appellant\u2019s lawyer regardless of who asked him to write a letter. This letter does not make any mention of the Appellant\u2019s allegations that he recognized and confronted an army officer who abducted his girlfriend. This is the core reason that triggered the Appellant\u2019s problems with authorities and led to him fleeing the country. For a lawyer to submit a letter that makes no mention of this is a major credibility issue. The Appellant himself requested that I re-examine the weight that should be placed on this letter. I have done this and come to the conclusion that it raises serious credibility concerns relating to the Appellant\u2019s core allegations of recognizing and confronting one of his girlfriend\u2019s abductors. This, in turn, calls into question whether or not the Appellant was actually targeted by the authorities in 2018. Evasive testimony as to whether or not his girlfriend complained to relevant authorities following the Appellant\u2019s identification of one of his girlfriend\u2019s abductors In his BOC, the Appellant alleges that he was interrogated and tortured by the army because they believed that he had told the media and a human rights organization about the officer who abducted his girlfriend. He further explains that it was actually his sister who had complained to a human rights organization that her friend\u2019s kidnapper had been identified. However, in the hearing, the Appellant was evasive in describing whether or not his girlfriend even complained to a human rights organization in the first place. The RPD made a negative credibility inference due to the Appellant\u2019s evasive testimony on this point. The Appellant does not contest this conclusion and I agree with it. The Appellant first said in his BOC that his girlfriend spoke to a human rights organization. He then admitted that he did not know this for sure but only inferred that she did because he was interrogated about this while being detained. He further testified that he never spoke to his girlfriend after being released from custody, even after travelling to Canada. The Appellant appears to be unsure of what exactly led to his detention and, despite stating the reasons with certainty in his BOC, his testimony was evasive as to this crucial aspect of his claim. I agree with the RPD that this evasive and contradictory testimony impacts his credibility. Incidents alleged in 2018 are not established I have identified two major credibility concerns relating to the Appellant being targeted and detained by the army after recognizing one of his girlfriend\u2019s abductors. His own lawyer inconsistently describes why he was detained and his own testimony surrounding what led to his detention was evasive. I find that the Appellant has not established that he recognized or confronted an officer involved in his girlfriend\u2019s abduction and that he was not targeted or detained by the army in 2018. I acknowledge that there is a letter from a priest which states that the Appellant lived in a church in hiding in 2018 and that he was arrested due to being a witness to his girlfriend\u2019s abduction. However, this letter does not corroborate the incidents alleged in 2018 that led him to go into hiding and flee the country. It also does not outweigh the credibility concerns I have outlined above. I give it little weight in establishing the incidents alleged in 2018. Other than the lawyer\u2019s letter which I have discussed above, there is no other documentary evidence to corroborate the Appellant\u2019s allegations in 2018. Given the credibility concerns associated with these allegations, I find that they are not established. As the Appellant points out, it is the events that allegedly took place in 2018 that led him to flee the country and claim refugee status. I have found that these events are not established, on a balance of probabilities. Regardless of whether or not he witnessed his girlfriend\u2019s abduction in 2007, I do not find that these older allegations are sufficient to establish that he would face a serious possibility of persecution in Sri Lanka today. Even if he did witness his girlfriend\u2019s abduction, this incident took place so long ago and there is nothing in the record that suggests that he would be targeted today because of what happened in 2007. As I have found that the earlier allegations relating to the Appellant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s abduction in 2007 would not lead him to face a serious possibility of persecution today upon return to Sri Lanka, I do not need to address the RPD conclusions, nor the Appellant\u2019s arguments in relation to these allegations in this decision. The Appellant would not face a serious possibility of persecution as a young Tamil male returning to Sri Lanka after claiming refugee status abroad The Appellant points to the mistreatment of rejected refugee claimants who return to Sri Lanka. Tamil returnees who claimed refugee status abroad and return to Sri Lanka are sometimes interrogated and detained at the airport. While this is a risk for the Appellant, he is not currently sought by authorities as I have found that his allegations from 2018 are not established. I do not find this risk in isolation to be sufficient to establish that he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. I note that the situation of returnees has been improving as Sri Lanka is aware that authorities from other countries are monitoring the situation. I also note that many of the individuals detained have been or are suspected of being involved with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The Appellant has never been involved with the LTTE and has never alleged that the authorities have suspected him of being involved, and this decreases the chances that he would face issues as a Tamil returnee to Sri Lanka. The Appellant further alleges that he would face discrimination amounting to persecution as a young Tamil male in Sri Lanka. I agree with the RPD that this discrimination does not rise to the level of persecution. The Appellant worked and lived for many years in Sri Lanka without any particular problems. While suspected sympathizers of the LTTE are still subject to arbitrary arrest, the Appellant has not alleged that he is an LTTE sympathizer. Even though much of the North remains under army control, I do not find that this represents a serious possibility of persecution for the Appellant. For the same reasons, he would also not face any of the risks contemplated under section 97, on a balance of probabilities.

Overview [1] This case concerns the decision of a Canada Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d) Inland Enforcement Officer (the \u201cOfficer\u201d) to deny a deferral request of the Applicants\u2019 removal order to Mexico (\u201cDeferral Decision\u201d). The Applicants are a Tamil mother and daughter from Sri Lanka. The Applicants fled Sri Lanka in 2009. [2] In 2012, the Applicants travelled through Mexico in order to join their family in Canada. However, while in transit in Mexico, the Applicants were detained. As a result, they made refugee claims to avoid removal back to Sri Lanka. The Applicants were granted Convention refugee status in Mexico, but left for Canada after five months. [3] The Applicants have a pending application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds (\u201cH&C\u201d) since June 2018. [4] On April 11, 2019, CBSA issued the Applicants a Direction to Report for scheduled removal to Mexico on April 30, 2019. The Applicants submitted a request to defer removal until their H&C application would be decided. [5] On April 26, 2019, the Officer denied the Applicants\u2019 request for a deferral of the removal order pursuant to section 48 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 (\u201cIRPA\u201d) to enforce removal orders as soon as reasonably practicable. [6] The Applicants submit that the Officer made significant errors in his assessment of the medical evidence, and erred in his hardship assessment by conflating the test for risk with that of hardship. The Applicants submit the Officer also ignored and misconstrued evidence in his consideration of hardship. Furthermore, the Applicants submit the Officer unreasonably required the Applicants to show proof that a decision on their H&C application is imminent, and unreasonably ignored and misconstrued statistical evidence from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\u201cIRCC\u201d) on processing times provided by the Applicants. [7] The Deferral Decision is unreasonable. This application for judicial review is granted. II. Facts A. The Applicants [8] Mrs. Rasaledchumy Thangeswaran (the \u201cPrincipal Applicant\u201d) and her daughter Desiny Thangeswaran (the \u201cAssociate Applicant\u201d) are citizens of Sri Lanka, with Convention refugee status in Mexico. They are respectively 47 and 20 years old. [9] The Principal Applicant was born in the village of Mallavi, Vanni in the northern province of Sri Lanka. After the outbreak of the Sri Lankan civil war in 1983, the Principal Applicant\u2019s brother Yogeswaran fled around 1989 to Canada because he was pressured to join the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (\u201cLTTE\u201d) and was at risk of being harmed or killed by the Sri Lankan army for being a young Tamil man. Yogeswaran obtained Convention refugee status in Canada. [10] The Principal Applicant was able to avoid joining the LTTE because her mother paid them a fee. In 1990, the Principal Applicant met her late husband Thangeswaran Uruththiran, who had joined the LTTE in 1986 after witnessing the murder of his uncle by the Sri Lankan army. Mr. Uruththiran left the LTTE in 1991. The couple married in 1992. After their marriage, the Principal Applicant worked as a teacher, and her husband as a farmer. They had four children together, the youngest of which was Desiny, the Associate Applicant. [11] In 1999, the Principal Applicant\u2019s husband was forced to return to the LTTE to work as a border guard. He was killed by shellfire on December 3, 1999. As the Principal Applicant\u2019s children were very young at the time (with her eldest daughter being 7 years old and the Associate Applicant only 7 months old), the Principal Applicant moved in with her in-laws for some time. [12] After several years of ceasefire, at the beginning of 2006, the LTTE began carrying out attacks on the Sri Lankan army. In 2006, the village of Kalmadu\u2014where the Principal Applicant\u2019s family lived\u2014came under army control, and the Principal Applicant feared being targeted by the Sri Lankan army, as her husband had died fighting for the LTTE. The Principal Applicant notes that soldiers from the Sri Lankan army searched her in-laws\u2019 house. [13] In 2008, the Sri Lankan army began to recapture the area where the Principal Applicant and her family lived. The Principal Applicant fled with her family and ended up in Mullaivaikal. After the LTTE was defeated, the Principal Applicant and her three older children were sent to a camp for internally displaced people (\u201cIDP\u201d) in Vavuniya. The Associate Applicant stayed with her paternal grandmother. The Principal Applicant was eventually arrested by the Sri Lankan army and separated from her children. During the 10 days that she was held, the Principal Applicant was interrogated, beaten, and threatened with sexual abuse. She was subsequently smuggled from the camp with the help of her brother. [14] In 2009, the Applicants fled Sri Lanka and travelled to France via Malaysia. The Principal Applicant\u2019s son Piraveen also travelled with the Applicants, but he was detained briefly in Malaysia before being returned back to Sri Lanka. In France, the Applicants made claims for refugee protection, but the claims were rejected after approximately a year. [15] In April 2012, the Applicants travelled to Mexico with the intention to go to Canada, where the Principal Applicant had extensive family ties. However, the Applicants were detained in Mexico, and were sent to an immigration detention camp in Acayucan, where they spent several months. The conditions in the camp were very poor. Initially, the Applicants did not want to make a refugee claim in Mexico because they had intended on travelling to Canada, their final destination. However, out of fear of deportation back to Sri Lanka, the Applicants ended up making a refugee claim in Mexico. [16] The Applicants were granted Convention refugee status in Mexico. The Principal Applicant decided that she and her daughter could not stay in Mexico because they did not speak Spanish and did not know anyone in the country. In their application, the Applicants claim they did not encounter another Tamil person in Mexico. The Principal Applicant\u2019s brother arranged the Applicants\u2019 journey from Mexico to Canada via the U.S. through a smuggler. [17] On September 28, 2012, the Applicants were caught by U.S. authorities and taken to a Texas border crossing. After a brief detention, when the U.S. authorities learned the Applicants wanted to reach their family in Canada, they arranged for the Applicants to take a bus to Buffalo, New York. The Applicants stayed at a refugee shelter where they received assistance to make a refugee claim at the Canada-U.S. border. [18] On November 29, 2012, the Applicants made their refugee claims at the border. After entering Canada, the Applicants stayed with the Principal Applicant\u2019s sister, brother-in-law, mother, brother, and nieces in Ottawa. [19] In 2015, the Principal Applicant was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in her uterus, and had a hysterectomy as a result. She continues to require follow-up with her gynecologist every six months for monitoring. After the surgery, the Principal Applicant was also diagnosed with depression. She was later diagnosed by a psychologist with Major Depressive Disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d). [20] In September 2017, the Applicants moved to Markham, Ontario to live with the Principal Applicant\u2019s brother and his family. [21] After learning that they had been granted refugee status in Mexico and thus ineligible for refugee status in Canada, the Applicants withdrew their claims for refugee protection on May 30, 2018. On June 22, 2018, the Applicants submitted an application for permanent residence on H&C grounds. [22] On April 11, 2019, the Applicants were issued a Direction to Report for removal to Mexico scheduled for April 30, 2019. On April 15, 2019, the Applicants submitted a request for deferral of removal, until a decision would be made on the pending H&C application. The deferral was requested on the basis of the pending H&C application, the detrimental impact of the removal on the Principal Applicant\u2019s physical and mental health, and the significant hardship and lack of support the Applicants would face in Mexico. B. Underlying Decision [23] On April 26, 2019, the Officer refused the Applicants\u2019 deferral request for removal. [24] After quoting an excerpt from the counsel\u2019s submissions for deferral, the Officer stated that he had considered all the statements and submissions, and noted the Applicants\u2019 pending H&C application had been submitted on June 22, 2018. The Officer noted that the processing time for in-Canada H&C applications as posted on the IRCC website was 31 months, and found that the Applicants\u2019 statements and statistical information of a shorter processing of an H&C application was \u201cspeculative in nature\u201d. The Officer concluded there was insufficient evidence submitted to show that the decision on the application was imminent. [25] In considering the impact of hardship to the Applicants should they be removed, the Officer noted, \u201csome hardship related to employment and developing relationships is a normal consequence of removal.\u201d The Officer addressed the Principal Applicant\u2019s lack of Spanish-speaking abilities, and the Associate Applicant\u2019s limited knowledge of Spanish, but found the Applicants to be \u201chighly adaptable to new circumstances\u201d because they had \u201ctravelled through several countries including Malaysia, France, Mexico and U.S.A. and they [had] made a refugee claim in France and Mexico.\u201d [26] The Officer further noted that although limited, Mexico provides settlement resources for immigrants. The Officer found that the Applicants\u2019 submissions did not constitute unusual or disproportionate hardship, and that insufficient evidence was provided to show the Applicants would be unable to find employment or adapt in Mexico. The Officer found the statements regarding employment to be \u201cspeculative in nature\u201d. [27] In considering the risks to the Applicants and their claim that they would be targeted by criminals, the Officer stated that the documents regarding criminality and the socio-economic situation in Mexico were general in nature and did not mention the Applicants personally. The Officer acknowledged the situation in Mexico is not perfect, but that the government was taking steps to improve the situation. Moreover, the Officer found that insufficient evidence was submitted to show that the Applicants would be personally targeted by criminals. [28] On the issue of establishment, the Officer noted that the Applicants have family and friends in Canada; the Principal Applicant is employed and her daughter is applying for post-secondary studies; and the Applicants are volunteering and contributing to the Canadian economy. However, the Officer concluded these factors alone did not warrant a stay of removal. The Officer also reiterated the fact that the Applicants had been to Mexico before, and thereby inferred they would be \u201chighly adaptable\u201d to Mexico despite some period of adjustment. [29] After reviewing hardship regarding family separation, and the best interests of the children (the Principal Applicants\u2019 nieces and nephews), the Officer found these factors did not warrant a deferral of removal. [30] The Officer addressed the Principal Applicant\u2019s medical issues and found that \u201cwhile removal from Canada may be difficult and cause some anxiety, it will require a period of adjustments which is reasonable and understandable\u201d. Moreover, the Officer noted that while the removal will be \u201cstressful\u201d for the Principal Applicant who has \u201csome psychological issues\u201d, the provided documents did not preclude her from travel by air. Regarding the issue of benign fibroma for the Principal Applicant, the Officer found there was insufficient evidence to show the Principal Applicant would be unable to monitor the situation with a gynecologist in Mexico. The Officer also concluded insufficient evidence was submitted to show the Principal Applicant could not receive medical treatment for her conditions. [31] The Officer noted the Applicants had plenty of time to prepare for their removal from Canada. When the Applicants submitted their refugee claim in 2012, they were issued a conditional removal order and advised that they would be expected to arrange the return to Mexico, if their claim was withdrawn or refused. III. Issue and Standard of Review [32] The issue on this application for judicial review is whether the Officer\u2019s decision is reasonable. [33] Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (CanLII) [Vavilov], the reasonableness standard generally applied to the review of decisions made by enforcement officers under section 48 of the IRPA, as in the case at bar: Lewis v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 FCA 130 (CanLII) at para 43; Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v Shpati, 2011 FCA 286 (CanLII) at para 27; Baron v Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2009 FCA 81 (CanLII) at para 25 [Baron]. [34] The applicable standard of review of the Deferral Decision must be determined in accordance with the framework set out in Vavilov. The revised standard of review analysis begins with the presumption of reasonableness, which can be rebutted in two types of situations. The first is where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard to apply. This will be the case where it has explicitly prescribed the applicable standard of review, or where it has provided a statutory appeal mechanism from the administrative decision maker to a court (Vavilov at para 17). [35] The second situation is where the rule of law requires that the standard of correctness be applied, for example in certain categories of legal questions, namely constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole and questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (Vavilov at para 17). [36] However, given that neither exception applies to the case at bar, the presumption of reasonableness review applies. [37] As noted by the majority in Vavilov, \u201ca reasonable decision is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker,\u201d (Vavilov at para 85). Furthermore, \u201cthe reviewing court must be satisfied that there are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency,\u201d (Vavilov at para 100). It is important to bear in mind that, \u201cMany administrative decision makers are entrusted with an extraordinary degree of power over the lives of ordinary people, including the most vulnerable among us. The corollary to that power is a heightened responsibility on the part of administrative decision makers to ensure that their reasons demonstrate that they have considered the consequences of a decision and that those consequences are justified in light of the facts and law,\u201d (Vavilov at para 135). IV. Analysis [38] The Applicants submit that the compelling grounds in their H&C application\u2014the hardship they would face in Mexico without support, family, or community; the potential deterioration of the Principal Applicant\u2019s physical and mental health conditions; and the Applicants\u2019 establishment and close family ties to Canada\u2014warrant the exercise of discretion to defer removal, and that the Officer\u2019s decision was unreasonable. [39] The Applicants rely on Ramada v Canada (Solicitor General), 2005 FC 1112 (CanLII) for the proposition that circumstances warranting deferral include humanitarian and compassionate considerations. The Applicants cite Baron for the proposition that a pending permanent residence application that raises special humanitarian and compassionate considerations can justify deferral. The Applicants submit an enforcement officer is also obligated to consider allegations of risk (Wong v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2015 FC 966 (CanLII) and Etienne v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2015 FC 415 (CanLII)). A. Medical Evidence [40] The Applicants make several submissions regarding the Officer\u2019s assessment of medical evidence. The Applicants claim there was significant and probative evidence of the Principal Applicant\u2019s mental and physical conditions including a psychological assessment from 2018, a recent letter from a Nurse Practitioner who treated the Principal Applicant for several years, and other letters from health professionals involved in the Principal Applicant\u2019s care. [41] First, the Applicants submit the Officer made a blanket statement that he considered all the medical documents submitted, but did not refer to specific assessments or pieces of evidence, other than by a quote from the counsel\u2019s submissions. The Applicants submit that the Officer\u2019s language in his reasons (such as \u201cmay be difficult and cause some anxiety\u201d and \u201crequire a period of adjustment\u201d) imply that the Officer ignored or misunderstood the medical evidence. Although presented with the presence of significant psychological disorders\u2014Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD\u2014the Officer did not consider their effects on the Principal Applicant, and simply stated that she would be able to travel by air. [42] The Applicants rely on Cepeda-Gutierrez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 8667 (FC) and Rahimi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 56 (CanLII) at paras 13-14 for the principle that \u201ca court may also infer that findings have been made without regard to the evidence where those findings have been made without reference to directly contradictory and relevant evidence.\u201d The Applicants submit that the Principal Applicant\u2019s mental health evidence was highly relevant to her current state and the effect of the removal, but that the Officer erred in showing a disregard for the mental health evidence. [43] Second, the Applicants argue the Officer improperly required the Applicants to establish that medical treatment was not available in Mexico, and thus made findings that do not comport with the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Kanthasamy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61 [Kanthasamy]. The Applicants rely on Danyi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 112 (CanLII) at paras 38-39 [Danyi], where the Court held the discussion of treatment of medical evidence in Kanthasamy is equally applicable in the deferral context. [44] Third, the Applicants submit the Officer ignored evidence on the unavailability of medical treatment in Mexico. The Applicants argue they had adduced evidence about deficiencies in the healthcare system in Mexico, which would affect the Principal Applicant, including country documents that indicate mental health care in Mexico is limited, with significantly fewer resources than in Canada and the U.S. One of the reports indicates that Mexico\u2019s mental health care centres often lack sufficient minimum personnel to cover the demand for treatment. [45] The Applicants cite Wells v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 FC 351 (CanLII) [Wells] at paras 6, 13-18 for the proposition that an officer\u2019s failure to consider evidence on the availability of medical care is a reviewable error. The Applicants submit the case at bar bears similarity to Ismail v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 845 [Ismail] at paras 15, 19 where the Court held the officer must analyze the evidence, instead of simply \u201cacknowledging\u201d and \u201cnoting\u201d the evidence. [46] The Respondent submits the Officer did refer to the Principal Applicant\u2019s medical conditions by quoting the counsel\u2019s submissions. The Respondent also submits the Court has found an applicant\u2019s physical ability to comply, i.e. fitness to travel, to be a factor that can be considered in a deferral of removal. Furthermore, the Respondent submits the Officer reasonably considered psychiatric evidence and argues officers are entitled to ascribe low weight to evidence prepared for the purpose of litigation. The Respondent argues it is clear from the Officer\u2019s reasons that the medical documents were considered and that an officer is presumed to have considered all the evidence. [47] The Respondent submits the Applicant\u2019s reliance on Danyi and Kanthasamy are misplaced. The Respondent argues Danyi can be distinguished from the present case because it involved a Roma family that was fleeing persecution, while the Applicants have Convention refugee status in Mexico. Also, in Danyi, the decision involved the officer\u2019s failure to consider the best interests of the child. The Respondent argues Kanthasamy is distinguished from the present case as it involves an H&C application. [48] On the availability of medical treatment in Mexico, the Respondent submits the Officer was not obligated to conduct an H&C assessment, and relies on Munar v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1180 (CanLII) at para 36. The Respondent argues the Officer did consider the Applicant\u2019s medical conditions. The Respondent cites Gumbura v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2008 FC 833 (CanLII) at para 14 for the proposition that better care availability in Canada is not a ground for deferral, and Melnykova v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 136 (CanLII) at para 73 for the proposition that it is reasonable for a deferral officer to consider the sufficiency of evidence on whether medical treatment would be available to the applicant when removed. [49] The Respondent further submits the Applicants\u2019 reliance on the Ismail decision is misplaced because the Court had taken issue with the officer\u2019s conclusions that were contradicted by the evidence on record, with respect to the applicant\u2019s family members being wholly financially dependent on the applicant. The Respondent submits the same circumstances do not apply in the case at bar. [50] In my view, the Officer\u2019s decision in the case at bar bears great resemblance to that of the officer in Danyi, in finding that insufficient medical evidence existed to show the Principal Applicant could not receive treatment for her conditions in Mexico, or monitor health issues. In Danyi, the Court found the officer\u2019s decision problematic for its failure to consider the fact that removal itself could trigger psychological harm to the applicant and its improper focus on the availability of treatment options in the country of origin. I agree with the Applicants that the Officer committed the same error in the present case. [51] As noted by the Applicants, Major Depressive Disorder and PTSD are serious mental health issues that may pose an aggravated psychological harm to the Principal Applicant should she be removed to Mexico. The psychologist\u2019s letter had opined that the Principal Applicant\u2019s prognosis was likely to worsen and \u201clead to a significant deterioration in [her] mental health,\u201d if the Principal Applicant was removed. However, the Officer failed to properly consider the medical evidence when he simply stated that removal may \u201cbe difficult and cause some anxiety\u201d during a \u201cperiod of adjustment\u201d, and focused on the availability of treatment in Mexico. Unlike the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the case in Danyi is strictly limited to an analysis on the best interests of the child, the Court in Danyi found that the officer had erred in its assessment of the adult female applicant\u2019s medical psychological evidence. [52] Furthermore, the Officer erred by ignoring evidence on the lack of availability of medical treatment in Mexico. The Principal Applicant requires regular follow-ups on her previously treated squamous cell carcinoma. However, as the country documentation indicates, resources for mental health care in Mexico is limited with lacking personnel to cover demand for patient treatment. A person who has an illness or medical condition that does not fall within the scope of the health package must cover the entire cost of the medical needs. For instance, one report notes that the national health insurance would not cover the service required by the Principal Applicant. The national health insurance only covers six types of cancer\u2014breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma, and childhood leukemia\u2014which is inapplicable to the Principal Applicant since she requires monitoring on squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. Many of the treatment centres lack necessary equipment to provide optimal care, and the quality of treatment provided is affected by the shortage of oncologists. [53] As correctly noted by the Applicants, the officer\u2019s language in Wells is similar to the present case at bar. In Wells, the officer stated that while the mental health system in Trinidad is different than the one in Canada, it does exist and no evidence was submitted to show the applicant would be denied treatment for his condition (Wells at para 8). Similarly, in the present case, the Officer, while acknowledging the medical system in Mexico may be different from Canada, noted that insufficient evidence was submitted to show treatment for the Principal Applicant\u2019s conditions would not be available in Mexico. [54] I note that in Wells, the officer stated there was no evidence (when in fact the applicant had submitted evidence), and in the present case, the Officer takes issue with the sufficiency. Nevertheless, in my view, the Officer\u2019s reasons in the case at bar do not exhibit transparency or intelligibility as to why the submitted evidence did not address the Officer\u2019s questions on the non-availability of treatment for the Principal Applicant. [55] As for the Respondent\u2019s reliance on Gumbura and Melnykova, I find that neither case is applicable to the case at bar. The argument is not whether the availability of better care in Canada is a ground of deferral. Also, although it is reasonable for an enforcement officer to consider the sufficiency of evidence on medical treatment in the country of removal, the issue here is that the Officer unreasonably found there to be insufficient evidence, without actually having engaged with the evidence. [56] Thus, I find that the Officer\u2019s decision is unreasonable with respect to the assessment of medical evidence. B. Hardship [57] The Applicants argue that the Officer improperly required the Applicants to adduce evidence naming them personally, and conflated a risk assessment under section 96 or 97 of the IRPA with a hardship assessment. The Applicants rely on Henriquez v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 437 (CanLII) [Henriquez] at paras 11-15, where the Court found it was a reviewable error for an officer to require that country articles and reports personally mention an applicant, in the context of a deferral request. The Applicants argue that although Henriquez dealt with a risk assessment, the principles also apply when an officer conducts a hardship assessment. [58] The Respondent submits that the present case can be distinguished from Henriquez because the Applicants have protected status in Mexico. The Respondent also submits the Officer did not require that the country reports must cite the Applicants by name, but only noted the documents were general in nature and did not mention the Applicants personally. [59] In this case, I am not persuaded by the Respondent\u2019s argument that the present case can be distinguished from Henriquez only on the basis that the Applicants have status in Mexico. As stated by Justice Boswell in Nguyen v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 FC 225 (CanLII) [Nguyen], \u201cAn enforcement officer\u2019s discretion to defer removal under section 48 of the IRPA is focused on harm,\u201d (Nguyen at para 24). In an assessment of harm, the existence of status does not necessarily preclude the Applicants from being exposed to harm if they are to be removed to Mexico. [60] As for the Respondent\u2019s argument that the Officer did not require the country reports cite the Applicants by name, I find that the Officer\u2019s reasons cannot be read in any other way than to require the Applicants to have established a personal mention of their names in the country condition information. [61] I note that although the Applicants had not submitted allegations of risk as a reason for their deferral request, from a reading of the Officer\u2019s reasons, it appears the Officer engaged in a risk assessment in addition to the hardship assessment. Before diving into the analysis, the Officer states that he has \u201cconsidered the hardships and risks to [the Applicants] if they were removed from Canada.\u201d Furthermore, after a paragraph discussing hardship, the Officer states, \u201cI also considered the risks to [the Applicants]\u2026\u201d [62] If the Officer had attempted a risk assessment, the case in Henriquez would be applicable to the case at bar, and it would form a reviewable error for the Officer to have required that country documentation personally mention an applicant. As the Court notes in Henriquez, \u201cIt is not often, unless the person is a politician, military officer, or another high profile individual in a leadership position, that the independent country condition reports would ever mention an applicant by name. The Officer was looking for proof of a serious risk that was akin to a wanted poster. Of course, this is not the test.\u201d [63] Under a hardship assessment, we may be guided by Kanthasamy, in which the Supreme Court stated, \u201c\u2026applicants need only show that they would likely be affected by adverse conditions such as discrimination. Evidence of discrimination experienced by others who share the applicant\u2019s identity is therefore clearly relevant under s. 25(1), whether or not the applicant has evidence of being personally targeted, and reasonable inferences can be drawn from those experiences,\u201d (Kanthasamy at para 56) in the context of discussing adverse country conditions and discrimination. Although Kanthasamy involved the judicial review of an H&C decision, in my view, the principles of assessing hardship can be imported into the deferral context where enforcement officers are assessing harm or threats to personal safety. [64] However, irrespective of whether the Officer undertook a hardship or risk analysis, in neither case are the Applicants required to provide evidence of personal mention of names in country condition information. As a result, the Officer committed a reviewable error. Also, as I stated above, the assessment for enforcement officers is to consider harm to the Applicants. [65] Furthermore, in the context of a pending H&C application, which is at issue in the case at bar, a \u201cthreat to personal safety\u201d may also justify a deferral of removal, as noted by the Court in Newman v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FC 888 (CanLII) at para 26. However, in dismissing the country condition evidence for lack of personal mention of the Applicants\u2019 names, the Officer did not properly consider whether the evidence would establish a threat to personal safety for the Applicants. [66] For example, the Applicants had submitted several country documentation showing that refugees, migrants, and asylum seekers\u2014especially women\u2014in Mexico face dangerous conditions including high levels of violence, abuse and crimes. Other reports have found that: migrants and refugees in Mexico face acute risks of kidnapping, disappearance, sexual assault, and trafficking; migrants and refugees are targeted due to their nationality, race, gender, refugee status; and migrant women and girls have been trafficked to Mexico\u2019s southern border. [67] However, the Officer failed to address any of this evidence, and instead required the Applicants to be personally named, along with a finding that the Applicants would be \u201chighly adaptable to new circumstances\u201d in Mexico. This renders the Deferral Decision unreasonable. C. H&C Application [68] The Applicants submit that the Officer fettered his discretion by refusing to consider the removal until a decision would be made on the pending H&C application, and by requiring the Applicants to establish a decision on the pending application would be imminent. The Applicants also submit the Officer misapprehended evidence on the H&C application processing times because the Officer did not provide reasons for preferring the times posted on the IRCC\u2019s website to the IRCC statistics submitted by the Applicants, and failed to explain how the Applicants\u2019 statements were speculative. [69] The Applicants argue that it was incumbent on the Officer to consider the statistics purporting to show reduced success rates of H&C applications when applicants are removed from Canada. [70] The Respondent submits that the Officer reasonably referred to the IRCC\u2019s website for overall processing times. The Applicants\u2019 reliance on specific statistics, such as the 2017 processing time from the Vancouver office is an attempt to ask the Court to re-weigh the evidence. [71] In their deferral request, the Applicants had submitted statistics from IRCC to support their argument that although the published processing time for H&C applications is 30 months on average, decisions are being made much faster in reality. For example, in 2017, the Vancouver office\u2014which has carriage of the Applicants\u2019 file\u2014processed 80% of the approved applications in 12 months or less. The average processing time for approved applications was 14 months Canada-wide. Refused applications were processed in similar timeframes. [72] Generally, this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal have cautioned against drawing any conclusions from statistics absent any expert analysis (Es-Sayyid v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FCA 59 (CanLII) at paras 45-49; Gillani v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 533 (CanLII) at para 43; Zupko v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 1319 (CanLII) at para 22; Xuan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 673 (CanLII) at para 15). [73] However, given that the IRCC statistics submitted by the Applicants are straight-forward figures indicating processing times of inland H&C applications in a given year, I find it concerning for the Officer to have dismissed the submissions as \u201cspeculative\u201d. At the very least, the Officer could have offered a rationale for preferring the IRCC\u2019s website processing times to the actual processing times, but failed to do so. In this regard, the Officer\u2019s reasons fail to exhibit transparency and intelligibility. V. Certified Question [74] Counsel for each party was asked if there were any questions requiring certification. They each stated that there were no questions for certification and I concur. VI. Conclusion [75] This application for judicial review is granted. JUDGMENT in IMM-2612-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that The decision is set aside and the matter is to be returned for redetermination by a different decision-maker. There is no question to certify. \"Shirzad A.\" Judge FEDERAL COURT SOLICITORS OF RECORD DOCKET: IMM-2612-19 STYLE OF CAUSE: RASALEDCHUMY THANGESWARAN AND DESINY THANGESWARAN v THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLACE OF HEARING: TORONTO, ONTARIO DATE OF HEARING: JANUARY 8, 2020 JUDGMENT AND REASONS: AHMED J.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : MC008732 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION INTRODUCTION Soheil Mohib (the Appellant), is a citizen of Pakistan. He appeals the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rendered on March 9, 2020, rejecting his claim filed pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act). The RPD found that the Appellant was not credible, as to the basis of his claim, due to several inconsistencies and omissions in his evidence, as well as vague and evasive testimony on areas central to his claim. The RPD also concluded that the Appellant\u2019s failure to apply for asylum in the USA shows a lack of subjective fear. The Appellant submits that the panel erred in its credibility analysis and by rejecting his supporting documentation. The Appellant asks the Refugee Appeals Division (RAD) to grant the appeal or to return the file to the RPD for re-determination. OVERVIEW The Appellant fears persecution from members of his family, in-laws, religious persons as well as from the police because he had an extramarital relationship with a transgender person named Sasha. The Appellant alleges that he is only attracted to transgender persons who transitioned from male to female. The Appellant alleges that after his relationship was discovered in mid-October 2012 by his wife and brother-in-law, he suffered several incidents of retaliation. He received death threats, was beaten several times and a fatwa was issued against him. He was also arrested and tortured by the police. His transgender partner was raped by the assailants. The Appellant was also tied up and thrown in deep water and saved by a passerby. He decided to leave for Saudi Arabia on Saturday, March 9 2012. On June 3, 2014, the Appellant went to USA. He came to Canada on Friday, June 18 2018, and asked for asylum. At the hearing, the Appellant testified that he commenced a relationship with a transgender person in Canada. DECISION Based on my independent analysis of all the evidence on the file, including the recording of the hearing, I find that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment. Therefore, I set aside the RPD determination and declare the Appellant a Convention refugee. The appeal is allowed. STANDARD OF REVIEW The RAD is required to independently assess all the evidence and determine whether the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law, fact or mixed fact and law. Although in exceptional situations where the RPD had a meaningful advantage, the RAD can defer to its findings. In this case, the applicable standard of review is that of correctness. ANALYSIS Credibility Generally, a claimant\u2019s evidence given under oath is presumed to be truthful, unless there are valid reasons to doubt it. In this case, I am of the view that the RPD erred in its credibility assessment. The irregularities identified by the RPD, in the Appellant\u2019s evidence, are not sufficient to undermine the Appellant\u2019s credibility as to his sexual orientation. The RPD identified the following problems, with the Appellant\u2019s evidence, and concluded that the Appellant was not credible as to his sexual orientation: the Appellant failed to submit a support letter from his current partner in Montr\u00e9al or have that person appear as a witness at the hearing; the Appellant provided vague and evasive testimony regarding the aspects he liked about his transgender girlfriends and the process of acceptance of his sexual orientation; the Appellant provided contradictory information about the first time that he had sexual intercourse with Sasha, mentioning, at first, that it was in November 2011, and later saying that it was, in fact, prior to that; the Appellant omitted to write, in his Basis of claim form (BOC), that after he was caught with Sasha by the watchman at his place of work, his colleagues threatened to kill him; the Appellant failed to make efforts and take steps to claim asylum or obtain status in the USA over a period of four years and delayed coming to Canada to apply for asylum. The RPD rejected the supporting documentation submitted by the Appellant, in light of the credibility issues identified above and because it did not, in itself, establish, the Appellant\u2019s sexual orientation. The Appellant\u2019s relationships with transgender women The Appellant contests the RPD conclusions and submits that it was unreasonable for the panel to draw a negative credibility inference because his partner Meena was not available to testify at the hearing, given that the Appellant submitted proof of communication between himself and his girlfriend establishing that she had accepted to have sexual relationships with him and that she was transgender. I note that the Appellant submitted a series of messages from his Badoo account spanning over the course of two years, namely from 2018 to 2020. Although, the conversations are rather brief, they do establish that Meena had informed the Appellant that she is transgender and that they agreed to have sex together. The messages further show that the appellant had asked Meena to accompany him to the hearing, but she refused because she had to work that day. Based on the above, I am of the view that the RPD erred in concluding that the Appellant\u2019s credibility was negatively impacted. The Appellant submits that he provided reasonable answers in response to the panel\u2019s question as to what he liked about his girlfriends. It is normal that he spoke about their physical appearance, when meeting them for the first time, because he did not really know them yet. I agree that the panel\u2019s questions could be understood as relating to what attracted the Appellant to Sasha and Meena when they first met. As such, I am satisfied with the Appellant\u2019s answers which describe their physical appearance. The Appellant also explained that his girlfriends were serious and reliable, and that he liked how Meena talked and behaved. While I note that the panel was expecting more detailed testimony on this topic, such as feelings and emotions of joy, stress, or betrayal and how these emotions changed over time, I am of the view that the panel should have been more explicit with its questions and the areas that it wished the Appellant to expand upon. I find that the lack of details, in this case, does not support a negative credibility finding. I agree with the Appellant that he provided reasonable details of his sexual orientation, especially in light of the fact that this is a delicate subject which is difficult to rationalize. The Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE) Guidelines warn that decision makers should not rely on stereotypes or inappropriate assumptions in adjudicating cases involving SOGIE. Sexual intercourse with Sasha I agree with the RPD that the Appellant was inconsistent, in his testimony, as to the first time he had sex with Sasha, saying that it was in October 2012 at his place of work, while in his BOC he declared that the first time was in May 2010 in Lahore, after returning from Dubai. The Appellant explained that he thought that the RPD wanted to know about the time they were caught having sex. I give the Appellant the benefit of the doubt as it could have been a simple misunderstanding. The Appellant explained in detail, in his BOC, how he met Sasha and how each event unfolded in Pakistan after their relationship was discovered. He was consistent with respect of the main events in his story. I have no reason to impugn the Appellant\u2019s overall credibility based on the noted inconsistency. The RPD erred on this point. First threats against the claimant The Appellant submits that his BOC makes mention that he\u2019s colleagues, at work, were informed of his relationship with Sasha and that he was told that what he is doing is bad, and that no one would know or do anything if he were to be killed. The RPD is correct in saying that the Appellant did not mention that his colleagues threatened to kill him after finding out about his relationship with Sasha. However, I note that the Appellant did mention that his colleagues \u201cblamed\u201d him and said that what he was doing is \u201ca big sin\u201d. He declared that he was forced to quit his job as a result. He also indicated that he ran into some of his colleagues, at the market, four weeks later and they \u201cstarted chanting that shamed on both of you living like husband and wife. And you both are Hijray.\u201d While the Appellant may have misrepresented in his testimony that his colleagues told him that he would be \u201ckilled\u201d, he was consistent as to the fact that they found out that he had a sexual relationship with a transgender woman and they publicly shamed him for it, which in Pakistan can cost someone their life, as explained below (see paras.33-37). He was clear that he left his job the next day because he felt that his life was threatened. I am of the view that the inconsistency noted by the RPD, does not detract from the Appellant\u2019s credibility as to his sexual orientation or to the risk the Appellant would face in Pakistan for being a sexual minority. Documentary evidence I also agree with the Appellant that the RPD erred by rejecting: the affidavit from his friend Muhammad Khan; the conversations with Meena from 2018 to 2020. The RPD rejected this corroborative evidence based on the overall credibility problems in the Appellant\u2019s evidence. The panel also concluded that the online messages with Meena do not establish a relationship or a sexual preference for the claimant. I have no reason to impugn the credibility of the affidavit provided by the Appellant\u2019s friend or of the on-line messages, which appear to be authentic on their face. Also, as explained above, I overturned the RPD\u2019s non-credibility conclusions based on which the panel relied to reject this evidence. I find that the affidavit corroborates that the Appellant and Sasha took refuge at his friend\u2019s house, that Sasha was transgender, and that the Appellant called her wife. The RPD erred in assigning no weight to this document. While the on-line messages are brief and do not allow to establish the extent of the relationship between the Appellant and Sasha, they do establish that the Appellant knew that Sasha was transgender, and that the Appellant wanted to have sex with her. The RPD erred in assigning no weight to this document. Failure to ask for asylum in the United States Finally, the Appellant submits that his failure to ask for asylum in USA is not determinative of his credibility. I agree. The Appellant explained that he met with a lawyer who arranged for him a marriage as a way for him to stay in the USA. The Appellant established that he got married within the first year he got to the USA. His wife thereafter sponsored him to stay in the USA. However, he learned subsequently that his wife was a criminal, and she was sought by the police. His sponsorship application was also rejected in September 2016, causing him to lose his legal status in the USA. Although, the Appellant remained illegally in the USA until June 2018, he was no longer eligible, at that time, to apply for asylum, since he exceeded the one-year window for filing an application. Even though the Appellant did not provide a reasonable explanation for not coming to Canada earlier and apply for asylum, I am of the view that this is not determinative of his overall credibility as to his sexual orientation. The RPD erred. Based on the above, I am satisfied that the Appellant has established, on a balance of probabilities, that he is a sexual minority who is attracted to transgender women. The RPD erred in its credibility assessment. Prospective risk based on his sexual orientation The objective country documentation demonstrates that sexual minorities face \u201csevere social stigma\u201d, \u201cdiscrimination, violence, social boycott and degradation in social class and rank\u201d, and, in some cases, a serious threat to life in Pakistan. The Neengar Society president said that \u201c\u02bbLahore, Karachi and Islamabad are more liberal and accepting\u02bc of LGBT people than other areas of Pakistan, but that no one can openly claim to be gay or lesbian in Pakistan as it can still cost them their life to announce their sexuality in public\u02ee. According to the Australian DFAT, \u201cLGBTI people in Pakistan face high levels of official [\u2026] discrimination\u02ee. According to Human Rights Watch, there is \u201cgovernment persecution\u02ee towards transgender persons. According to US Country Reports 2017, the police \u201cgenerally refused to take action on cases involving members of the LGBTI community\u02ee. There are no laws that protect against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity\" in Pakistan. I am of the view that the Appellant will not be able to safely and openly live as a sexual minority and have open relationships with transwomen in Pakistan. I find that there is a serious possibility of the Appellant being persecuted for his sexual orientation throughout Pakistan and that no adequate state protection is available to him. As a result, I find that the Appellant is a Convention refugees under section 96 of the Act. CONCLUSION Pursuant to (b) of the , the RAD sets aside the RPD\u2019s determination and declares that the Appellant, Soheil Mohib, is a Convention refugee, pursuant to section 96 of the Act. The appeal is allowed.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200114 Docket: IMM-3798-19 Citation: 2020 FC 44 [UNREVISED CERTIFIED ENGLISH TRANSLATION] Ottawa, Ontario, January 14, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Roy BETWEEN: REN\u00c9 TRANCIL Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), confirming a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), concluding that the applicant cannot avail himself of Convention refugee or person in need of protection status in Canada under section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act]. I now reproduce section 98 of the Act: 98 A person referred to in section E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. 98 La personne vis\u00e9e aux sections E ou F de l\u2019article premier de la Convention sur les r\u00e9fugi\u00e9s ne peut avoir la qualit\u00e9 de r\u00e9fugi\u00e9 ni de personne \u00e0 prot\u00e9ger. It is Article 1E of the Refugee Convention that applies in this case and it reads as follows: E. This Convention shall not apply to a person who is recognized by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country. E. Cette Convention ne sera pas applicable \u00e0 une personne consid\u00e9r\u00e9e par les autorit\u00e9s comp\u00e9tentes du pays dans lequel cette personne a \u00e9tabli sa r\u00e9sidence comme ayant les droits et les obligations attach\u00e9s \u00e0 la possession de la nationalit\u00e9 de ce pays. [2] The applicant claims to be seeking judicial review of the RAD\u2019s decision under section 18.1 of the Federal Courts Act, RSC 1985, c F-7. This is not the case. An application for judicial review in immigration matters is made under section 72 of the Act. It is on that basis that this case must be examined. I. Facts [3] The facts of this case are particularly straightforward. The applicant is of Haitian citizenship and allegedly left his country in May 2013 to go to Santo Domingo. From there, he travelled to Ecuador and then to Peru, where he took the bus that took him somewhere in Brazil. The record does not elaborate on this point. [4] His decision to leave his country of citizenship stems from two episodes in which he was violently robbed of his rice crop. These two episodes occurred in October 2010 and 2012. [5] According to his account, the applicant was wanted by the robbers after the 2012 theft. He allegedly took refuge in Port-au-Prince, leaving his family with his mother. Seven months later, he left for South America. [6] After living in Brazil until July 2016, the applicant left Brazil by land, travelling to Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala and Mexico, and finally arriving in the United States in the fall of 2016. Here, too, the date is not especially clear. [7] He appears to have lived in the United States for a few months, from late 2016 to July 17, 2017, when he crossed into Canada illegally. He made a refugee protection claim in the weeks that followed; this claim was heard by the RPD on April 4, 2018. It was rejected in an oral decision. The appeal before the RAD was dismissed on May 10, 2019. II. Arguments and decision [8] The RAD\u2019s decision upholds the RPD\u2019s decision. Essentially, the RAD agreed that the applicant was not exposed to a prospective risk in Brazil. Applying the two-step analysis recognized in the case law, the RAD confirmed that the applicant can return to a country where he will benefit from the rights of the nationals of that country, Brazil. The Minister must make a prima facie case at this stage. Then, the applicant has to establish why he could not enjoy his rights in that country again. [9] In this case, there seems to be no doubt that the first part of the test was met. In fact, the applicant does not even dispute it. The RAD noted that the applicant\u2019s permanent residence gives him access to education, health, work, leisure, security, social security and assistance for those in need. The applicant argued that his right to work was made more difficult because of the unemployment in Brazil; however, the right to work does not consist of a right not to be exposed to unemployment, but rather of access to the labour market as a permanent resident. Reported restrictions are a prohibition on doing military service, a prohibition on voting and a prohibition on working in certain public offices. It is therefore clear that permanent residency in Brazil meets the conditions. [10] The difficulty faced by the applicant in this case is that he has produced no evidence of a situation in Brazil that could amount to any level of persecution. For him, [translation] \u201cthe main question is whether the RAD has fulfilled the mandate conferred on it by Parliament\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Factum, para 22). This is not a question that the Court can answer. At best, the Court can consider whether the test for the application of section 98 has been applied in a reasonable manner. This is the standard of review for the vast majority of issues that are dealt with by a court under judicial review (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65). [11] The applicant very honestly conceded that he did not personally experience a life-threatening situation in Brazil (Applicant\u2019s Factum, para 24). Nor does he deny having had residency in Brazil (Applicant\u2019s Factum, para 27). At most, the applicant claimed that it was his right to work that had been violated and that [translation] \u201clife in Brazil [had] become hell for him because of the economic and political crisis that [had] hit the country\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Factum, para 28). He is a collateral victim of the economic crisis and adds that native Brazilians blame the applicant and other Haitians for this crisis, at least partly. However, even if that were sufficient, there is not the slightest proof of this state of affairs. Ultimately, the applicant himself did not even prove it. In paragraph 31 of his factum, he even goes as far as complaining that [translation] \u201cthe applicant could no longer consider a normal and peaceful life in Brazil, particularly because this hardship is a result of his ethnic origin\u201d. [12] But where the demonstration is particularly flawed is when the applicant talks about the stigma that most Haitians in Brazil suffer. He claims that this stigma takes the form of persecution in some situations, such as that of the applicant. Not only is this a huge leap, but it is not supported by any evidence. We are therefore far from establishing that the RAD\u2019s conclusion was unreasonable. The Court further notes that no court decisions with similar facts support the applicant\u2019s claim. As noted earlier, the burden was on the applicant to establish this. His position was not supported by the evidence or the case law. Consequently, the application for judicial review must fail. [13] The parties agree, and the Court concurs, that this case raises no question to be certified under section 74 of the Act. JUDGMENT in IMM-3798-19 THE COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is as follows: The application for judicial review is dismissed; and No serious question of general importance is certified. \u201cYvan Roy\u201d Judge Certified true translation This 23rd day of January 2020.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200102 Docket: IMM-544-19 Citation: 2020 FC 3 Ottawa, Ontario, January 2, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Bell BETWEEN: SAID AL KHATIB Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview and Decision under Review [1] Mr. Al Khatib is a citizen of Lebanon and is married to a Canadian citizen. From 1993 to 2013, he was a member of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces [ISF], from which he retired as a Chief Warrant Officer. In November 2011, he applied for permanent residency in Canada via a spousal sponsorship. That application was refused for the first time in June 2017, in part, on the basis of misrepresentation under paragraph 40(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. The alleged misrepresentation was straightforward: Mr. Al Khatib reported in his application that he was not facing any criminal charges in Lebanon, when, in fact, he was facing two (2) criminal charges for which he was subsequently found guilty. The Program Manager rejected Mr. Al Khatib\u2019s contention that he misunderstood the question to be asking about criminal convictions rather than charges. The Program Manager noted that Mr. Al Khatib\u2019s spouse was a doctoral candidate in Canada, Mr. Al Khatib was a police officer and he had a formal legal education. The Program Manager also relied upon paragraph 35(1)(a) of the IRPA, finding Mr. Al Khatib to have been complicit in human or international rights violations while with the ISF, and paragraph 36(1)(a) of the IRPA, finding he participated in war crimes and crimes against humanity while serving with the ISF, in refusing the application. The Program Manager considered humanitarian and compassionate grounds but concluded they were insufficient to overcome the other obstacles to permanent residency. Mr. Al Khatib sought judicial review of the June 2017 decision. On agreement between Mr. Al Khatib and the Minister, Mr. Al Khatib discontinued the judicial review application. His application for permanent residency was remitted to another Program Manager for redetermination. [2] The second Program Manager to consider Mr. Al Khatib\u2019s application for permanent residency concluded there was insufficient evidence upon which to refuse the application on the basis of Mr. Al Khatib\u2019s alleged participation in war crimes and crimes against humanity (pursuant to para 36(1)(a) of the IRPA). The Program Manager did, however, maintain the refusal on the basis of misrepresentation (pursuant to para 40(1)(a) of the IRPA) and complicity in human and international rights violations (pursuant to para 35(1)(a) of the IRPA). The Program Manager refused to consider humanitarian and compassionate grounds because they were made following the coming into force of the Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals Act, SC 2013, c 16 on June 19, 2013, which prohibited considering humanitarian and compassionate grounds where an applicant is found inadmissible under section 35. It is that second decision, dated November 27, 2018, which is the subject of the within application for judicial review made pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the IRPA. II. Positions of the Parties [3] The Respondent consents to the application for judicial review and requests the matter be remitted to a different Program Manager for redetermination. Mr. Al Khatib agrees with the Respondent that the application for judicial review should be allowed. He, however, disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s proposed disposition. He contends this Court should grant the judicial review and, in addition, direct the Program Manager to allow the spousal sponsorship and order costs against the Respondent. III. Relevant Provisions [4] The relevant provisions are subsection 18.1(3) of the Federal Courts Act, RSC 1985, c F-7 and rule 22 of the Federal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules (SOR/93-22) as set out in the attached Schedule. IV. Analysis [5] First a word about nomenclature. I will, as directed by the Federal Court of Appeal in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Tennant, 2019 FCA 206 at para 73, 436 DLR (4th) 155 [Tennant] refrain from using the words \u201cdirected verdict\u201d or \u201cdirected outcome\u201d. I will refer to the substitution remedy sought by the applicant as certiorari with mandamus in aid. [6] Mr. Al Khatib contends it is appropriate for this Court to order the Program Manager to grant his application for permanent resident status through certiorari with mandamus in aid for two (2) reasons: first, there is only one lawful or reasonable response open to the decision-maker; and second, the inordinate delay in processing his application has resulted in an abuse of process. The respondent relies on Lebon v Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 FCA 55 at para 14, 444 NR 93 and D\u2019Errico v Canada (Attorney General), 2014 FCA 95 at paras 15-16, 459 NR 167. [7] Firstly, I am unable to agree with Mr. Al Khatib\u2019s contention there is only one lawful or reasonable response to his application for permanent residency. While the previous two (2) decision-makers have taken different approaches to the availability of relief based upon humanitarian and compassionate grounds and have reached different results on the issue of the application of paragraph 36(1)(a) (complicity in war crimes), both found Mr. Al Khatib to have misrepresented facts about criminal charges in his application. In my view, the alleged misrepresentation remains a live issue. Another decision maker, while required to consider the matter afresh, might well choose not to grant the application. Therefore, more than one lawful or reasonable outcome exists. See Tennant at paras 71-72 and the cases cited therein and Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para 142 and the cases cited therein. [8] Secondly, while accepting, without deciding, Mr. Al Khatib\u2019s contention that inordinate delay may result in abuse of process and bring the administration of justice into disrepute, and that such delay alone permits intervention by the Court through certiorari with mandamus in aid, I disagree that such a remedy is available in the circumstances. Abuse of process permits courts to stop proceedings that have become unfair or oppressive, which includes situations where there has been an unacceptable delay resulting in significant prejudice (Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 CSC 44 at para 101, [2000] 2 SCR 307 [Blencoe]). Whether delay is inordinate such that it justifies granting a stay of proceedings depends on all of the circumstances, including the purpose and nature of the case, its complexity, the facts and issues involved, and whether the affected person contributed to or waived the delay (Blencoe at para 122). This case is not simple. It is one that at various stages raised, and continues to raise, serious allegations of violations of international and human rights; serious allegations of violations of war crimes and crimes against humanity (which now seem to have been unproven); and a prima facie case of serious misrepresentation by an applicant who would seem to have known that he was not being truthful. Finally, there are serious questions, with mixed results by previous decision-makers, about the application of the Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals Act and the availability of relief on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. These are not minor matters. They engender complex analyses, such that both decision-makers convoked an oral interview with the applicant. [9] Mr. Al Khatib cites decisions of this Court in Beltran v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 516, 234 CRR (2d) 145 [Beltran]; Fabbiano v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1219, 32 Imm LR (4th) 84 [Fabbiano]; and Almrei v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1002, 31 Imm LR (4th) 92 [Almrei] to support his contention that inordinate delay can result in an abuse of process which warrants relief by way of a stay of proceedings or certiorari with mandamus in aid. Those cases can all be distinguished from the facts in the present case. [10] In Beltran, Mr. Beltran was granted refugee status in Canada in March 1988 and he applied for permanent residence status two (2) months later. The Canadian Security Intelligence Service interviewed Mr. Beltran in 1989 and concluded in its brief to Citizenship and Immigration Canada that he was not admissible to Canada on security grounds for having been involved in a terrorist organization. It was not until 2009 that he was referred to an inadmissibility hearing. The Court found \u201cMr. Beltran misrepresented nothing, and all the information necessary to proceed with an admissibility hearing was available for more than twenty years\u201d (Beltran at para 42). Despite having the information on hand for so many years, the Minister kept it \u201cup its sleeve\u201d and \u201cd[id] nothing about it\u201d for more than 20 years, which prejudiced Mr. Beltrans\u2019s ability to respond to the case against him and locate witnesses to support his case. To make matters worse, Mr. Beltran\u2019s application was also denied in 2007 due to his criminal record, which was \u201cclearly wrong\u201d as he had received a pardon in 2001. [11] In Fabbiano, Mr. Fabbiano had lived in Canada for more than 50 years. He applied for Canadian citizenship in 2005. In 2006, he was advised that he might be inadmissible for serious criminality for being a member of a criminal organization \u2013 the Hells Angels \u2013 due to which he had received a conviction of drug trafficking in 1999. In 2007, he responded to the allegations with an accompanying request for relief on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. He heard nothing further until 2013, when he was informed that he had been referred for an inadmissibility hearing. With the passing of those 14 years (1999 \u2013 2013), this Court concluded Mr. Fabbiano had lost the opportunity to present relevant evidence. This affected his right to a fair hearing resulting in a stay of the inadmissibility hearing. Moreover, he did not do anything to contribute to the delay. [12] In Almrei, while the facts and judicial history are somewhat complex, one can briefly summarize the matter by observing that the Minister was aware of information for 12 years that could have led to Mr. Almrei\u2019s inadmissibility on the basis of organized criminality under paragraph 37(1)(b) of the IRPA. These inadmissibility concerns had been raised collaterally on two (2) previous security certificate proceedings. This Court did not order a permanent injunction against the holding of an inadmissibility hearing, but, in the circumstances, ordered that the inadmissibility hearing be stayed pending the determination of an underlying judicial review application. [13] In the present case, Mr. Al Khatib was aware of the substance of the allegations made against him. The Minister did not \u201csit on\u201d relevant information without informing Mr. Al Khatib. He provided detailed responses to those allegations. It cannot be said that the delays incurred thus far have resulted in a denial of Mr. Al Khatib\u2019s right to a fair hearing. The delay has not precluded him from providing relevant evidence to support his case, and the decision-makers did not make their decisions based on outdated information. Furthermore, I am not satisfied the delay which will arise from remitting this matter for redetermination will result in the denial of a fair hearing. [14] Finally, on the issue of delays in general, an unexplained delay in processing an application will not necessarily result in an award of costs or justify the application of certiorari with mandamus in aid. See Gerges v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 106. In the circumstances, I am not satisfied there has been an unexplained delay. The case, as already mentioned, is complicated, with part of the complication being the misrepresentation, the responsibility for which rests with Mr. Al Khatib. [15] That said, while in my view the delay in this case does not warrant granting certiorari with mandamus in aid or costs in favour of the applicant, I recognize this application has been ongoing for several years at considerable cost to the applicant from a personal, financial and emotional perspective. For that reason, I am ordering that the redetermination be completed and communicated to Mr. Al Khatib within 90 days from the date of the filing of this decision with the Registry. V. Conclusion [16] In the circumstances, there will be an order that the matter be remitted to a different Program Manager for redetermination and that the decision be completed and communicated to Mr. Al Khatib within 90 days from the date of the filing of this decision with the Registry. There will be no order for costs. Furthermore, neither party proposed a question for certification to be considered by the Federal Court of Appeal and none arises from the facts. No question will therefore be certified. JUDGMENT in IMM-544-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT IS THAT: The application for judicial review is granted and the matter is remitted to a different Program Manager for redetermination; The redetermination shall be completed and communicated to the applicant within 90 days from the date of the filing of this decision with the Registry; No question is certified for consideration by the Federal Court of Appeal; There is no order of costs. \u201cB.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200115 Docket: IMM-3108-19 Citation: 2020 FC 49 [UNREVISED CERTIFIED ENGLISH TRANSLATION] Ottawa, Ontario, January 15, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Roy BETWEEN: AREZKI BOUARIF Applicant and THE MINISTER OF IMMIGRATION, REFUGEES AND CITIZENSHIP Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] This application for judicial review is related to the decision of the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) which, on April 5, 2019, upheld the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejecting the refugee protection claim made under sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act]. Obviously, the application for judicial review is filed pursuant to section 72 of the Act. The only issue in this case is whether the applicant\u2019s fear due to his religious beliefs in his country of origin, Algeria, was credible. Neither the RPD nor the RAD believed the applicant. To be successful in this judicial review, the applicant had to convince the Court that the RAD\u2019s decision was not reasonable. He did not succeed in doing so, and the application for judicial review must be dismissed. I. Facts [2] The facts of this case are simple. Mr. Bouarif is a resident of Algeria who stated that he gradually converted to Christianity starting in 2009. From his testimony, we note that from 2009 to 2014, there were only minor conflicts over his emerging religious practice, which he himself stated were not serious. It was in 2014, he stated, that things began to sour. It appears that November 2014 was the tipping point when lively discussions evolved into to a more difficult situation. [3] Actually, the applicant did not even claim in his Basis of Claim (BOC) Form to have suffered the said difficulties caused by the Islamists, but rather that groups of young people attacked in November 2014, and specifically on November 15, 2014, the house of a person who apparently taught certain precepts of the Christian religion. These young people allegedly threw stones at the roof of the house and two young Christians were attacked upon leaving the house by those who had thrown the stones. In December 2014, this same group reportedly came to the same house (the meeting place for prayer) where they ransacked everything and stole objects. Later in 2014, the village committee reportedly decided to exclude young Christians from all the village\u2019s social activities. Finally, in January 2015, the authorities reportedly ordered the closure of the house. It was then that the group went to a large church in the city of Ouadhia. [4] It was when that the applicant decided to leave his country because he felt excluded there. The applicant repeatedly stated during the hearing before the RPD that he was marginalized in his country. In a burst of transparency, he stated on page 32 of 110 that [translation] \u201c[m]y intention was to come here and stay here, and possibly ask the authorities here for their protection, asylum so that I could stay here because I was oppressed in my country\u201d. The administrative tribunals found that the applicant was neither a refugee nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Act. II. The RAD Decision [5] The only decision before this Court is the RAD decision. Essentially, the RAD follows the RPD\u2019s decision regarding the applicant\u2019s lack of credibility. The difficulties encountered by the applicant in convincing the RPD were numerous, as the two divisions noted. In paragraph 13 of its decision, the RAD reiterated the reasons why the RPD denied the refugee claim given the applicant\u2019s credibility: [translation] [13] In its decision, the RPD rejected the appellant\u2019s claim for the following reasons: - The appellant gave a prepared and vague testimony regarding the problems he had allegedly experienced in Algeria; - His testimony was vague as regards his knowledge of the Christian religion, testifying to a quasi-ignorance of it; - The appellant testified during his testimony to a personal incident that took place in November 2014 where Islamists allegedly wanted to attack him physically, but he never mentioned it on his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form); - The behaviour of the appellant, who took six months to apply for refugee protection once in Canada, is not that of a person fearful of returning to his country of origin. It was the accumulation of these elements that undermined the applicant\u2019s credibility. [6] In the reasons for its decision, the RAD took a more systematic look at some of the difficulties that made it necessary to maintain the finding of lack of credibility at its level, following its independent analysis conducted on the standard of correctness. His ignorance of a religion he claims to practise is striking. Besides Easter and Christmas, the applicant could not indicate any other religious holidays, explaining that he had been initiated recently. However, he himself declared having converted in 2009, eight years prior to his hearing before the RPD. In the opinion of the RAD, this is not an issue that requires expertise. One must agree. Likewise, it was rather striking that Mary, the mother of Christ, was presented as one of the twelve apostles. The attempt, later in the hearing, to refer to another Mary whom the applicant allegedly saw in a film did not improve matters since, in any case, the apostles were twelve men. Besides, the applicant seemed to confuse apostle and disciple. The RAD found that the applicant\u2019s knowledge of the religion he claimed to practise was meager, even erroneous (RAD Decision, para 26). Thus, the applicant did not satisfy his burden. What is more, the applicant was unable to identify a prayer, as specifically asked, simply saying, despite repeated questions, that he prayed often. The alleged frequency of his religious participation did not correspond to the most basic elements concerning it. The questions that were asked were general and in no way touched on the details. [7] Citing Gao v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1139, the RAD accepted this passage from that decision: [26] . . . This can be a difficult task for the Board, as it is entitled to consider whether the claimant holds a level of religious knowledge that would be expected of someone in the claimant\u2019s position but should not reach an adverse conclusion based on minutiae or holding the claimant to an unreasonably high standard of religious knowledge. In the opinion of the RAD, it was obviously this kind of general question that certainly did not require advanced religious knowledge. Anyone who claims to have adhered to a religion for which he was allegedly persecuted in his country of origin should know the most basic elements. The purpose is not to search hearts and minds, but rather to assess the credibility of the refugee claimant who claims to belong to a religion of which he does not know the basic precepts. [8] Nor is it being picky to draw a negative inference about credibility from the fact that the applicant did not mention the only bullying incident in his BOC Form that directly implicated him, according to his version of the facts given at the hearing before the RPD. The RPD noted that, [translation] \u201cat the end of (November) 2014 while he was in his village, during a meeting, he was allegedly threatened and insulted and they wanted to hit him. This event affecting the applicant personally is not indicated anywhere in his account. When asked why, the applicant, to explain it, stated that he had forgotten to mention it\u201d (RPD Decision, para 8). For the RPD, this was a significant omission. It remained unexplained. The RAD also found that this omission undermined the applicant\u2019s credibility (RAD Decision, para 44). The RAD noted that the wait of some six months before applying for refugee status in Canada affected the applicant\u2019s credibility with respect to a fear of persecution in connection with the practice of Christianity. Here again, [translation] \u201c[t]he SPR did not err, it considered this point as one factor among others in order to dismiss the appellant\u2019s request\u201d (RAD decision, para 53). III. Arguments and analysis [9] The applicant seeks to take up each of the points raised by the administrative tribunals and give them a different meaning. He does not demonstrate that the decision was unreasonable, but at most that he disagreed with the conclusions reached by the two administrative tribunals. There is no doubt that the standard of review in this area is that of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov]). In this recent decision, the Supreme Court again confirmed that the standard of reasonableness applies to administrative tribunals, with some exceptions. None of these exceptions were present or even invoked by the applicant. Here, the applicant pointed out what he considered to be three errors that taint the reasonableness of the decision: (a) the analytical framework adopted was unreasonable and erroneous because it allowed questioning in religious matters; (b) determinative factual errors marred the decision; and (c) it was unreasonable to consider that the applicant\u2019s delay in filing his refugee claim was inappropriate. [10] In the applicant\u2019s view, the questions posed by the RAD were aimed at imposing [translation] \u201ca biblical knowledge test\u201d rather than examining the authenticity and genuineness of his faith. In my view, he who says that he is persecuted because of his religious beliefs to the point of having to go into exile must be familiar with the basic information relating to this religious belief. This is only common sense to me. Faith is difficult to measure in court, but the authenticity of beliefs can be assessed. The state of the law in this regard seems to me to be well articulated in Li v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1273 [Li], at paragraph 15: [15] Ultimately, the RPD is tasked with determining if adherence to Falun Gong is motivated solely by a desire to support a refugee claim, in which case it is open to the RPD to find that the claimant\u2019s religious beliefs are not genuine, or if the claimant has developed faith to a point where he or she has become a true adherent to that religion, even if, initially, the adherence to that religion might have been motivated to support a refugee claim. This is not an easy task. It is well established in law that it is open to the RPD to assess and consider a refugee protection claimant\u2019s motive for practising a religion, including the genuineness of those religious beliefs, and to rely on that motive in rejecting the refugee protection claim in cases such as this one where the essence of the refugee claim rests on the allegation that continuing a newly acquired religious practice in the country of origin might place the refugee claimant at risk (Su v Citizenship and Immigration, 2013 FC 518, at para 18) In so doing, the RPD is entitled to assess the refugee claimant\u2019s knowledge of the details of the religion, although such inquiry must be approached with caution given the highly subjective and personal nature of a person\u2019s religious beliefs (Lin v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 288, at para 61). My colleague Justice LeBlanc continued in Li at paragraph 16 of his decision: [16] If the claimant is found not to be a genuine practitioner, then it is open to the RPD to hold that the claimant would not practice his or her claimed religion if returned to his or her country of origin and to determine, as a result, that the claimant faces no risk upon return (Hou v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 993, at para 62, 417 FTR 405 [Hou]). Findings that the claimant lacks credibility, that he or she has fabricated stories about practising the claimed religion in the country of origin and that his or her knowledge of the details of the claimed religion is lacking, have been held by this Court to reasonably support a conclusion that the sincerity of the claimant\u2019s religious beliefs is not genuine (Hou, at paras 54-55). [11] The Court, in judicial review, must avoid substituting its opinion for that of the administrative decision maker in whom responsibility has been entrusted by Parliament. Madam Justice Gleason, then of this Court, articulated the role of the reviewing court as follows in Hou v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 993, at paragraph 55: [55] Indeed, in all cases \u2013 and especially in cases like the present where the applicant\u2019s credibility is found to be wanting \u2013 the Court should not be too hasty to substitute its opinion for that of the RPD, which has developed expertise regarding the dictates of a number of religions. As Justice Near noted in Wang (cited above at para 8), assessing the genuineness of the claimant\u2019s religious beliefs is a difficult task and \u201cthis challenging job has been delegated to the Board as the finder of fact and this Court cannot, on judicial review, decide to, in effect, reweigh the results of what can look like a round of Bible trivia\u201d (at para 18). In my view, in Wang at para 20, Justice Near set out the proper approach to be adopted by this Court in assessing the reasonableness of the RPD\u2019s assessment of the genuineness of a claimant\u2019s religious beliefs. After reviewing an awkward set of questions the Board had posed regarding what Jesus was like, he stated: \u2026 this line of questioning illustrates the difficulty of the assessment the Board is required to make. It does not represent an error for which the Board\u2019s decision should be over-turned. Absent a showing of disregard for the evidence, or a misapprehension of the facts, I am unwilling to disturb the Board\u2019s conclusion in this regard \u2013 again deference is warranted. The Board did not make the determination of the genuineness of the Applicant\u2019s faith based solely on the Applicant\u2019s inability to attribute some human characteristics to Jesus. Answers to other questions regarding the Pentecostal faith were vague and lacking in detail. As the Respondent submits, testimony lacking in detail that would reasonably be expected of a person in the claimant\u2019s position is a basis for rejecting claims as non-credible even if the Applicant was able to answer some other questions, and with great detail. [Emphasis added.] [12] In my opinion, not being able to answer such basic questions as naming religious holidays, or identifying Mary as one of the twelve apostles, or for the applicant to offer a nebulous testimony when questioned on the knowledge of prayers, or even the fact that he was not baptized in Algeria because he did not have the time (between 2009 and 2015) whereas he did it in Canada, clearly illustrates that the RAD had before it evidence on which to base its conclusion that the applicant did not demonstrate the genuineness of his religious practice. This finding is reasonable. We are nowhere near asking questions that are probing and that stem from a microscopic analysis of an area as sensitive as religious identification. [13] One particular element deserves a closer look since the applicant insisted on it. I read the transcripts of the hearing before the RPD. It seems clear to me that when the applicant referred to Mary, he meant to refer to the mother of Christ. Before this Court, an attempt was made to reread these passages to suggest that he instead meant Mary Magdalene, one of the disciples of Christ according to the biblical account. When asked about a rather surprising answer that one of the apostles was Mary, the applicant then spoke of another Mary, without ever identifying her. The ambiguity arose from a film that the applicant saw. Not only do we know nothing about this other film, but it must be noted that none of the twelve apostles, according to the most basic reading of the Bible, was a woman. In addition, it was while he was attempting to change tack that he referred to a passage in a film in which a second Mary appeared. What is more, the applicant made no reference at all to who this other Mary could have been, let alone that it might have been Mary Magdalene. Rather, it was the applicant\u2019s lawyer who very honestly confirmed that it was a conjecture on his part. In my opinion, this does not change the conclusion reached by the RAD (pages 83\u201385 of 110 of the transcript of the hearing of February 17, 2017, produced in the affidavit of Ketsia Dorceus). In fact, the knowledge of a religion based on a vague recollection of a film is in itself astonishing for one who claims to be of this religion. [14] The omission in the BOC Form of a close call with a violent confrontation is also significant. It would be inappropriate to draw an unfavourable conclusion from a minor fact that was not noted in the BOC Form. The situation becomes more perilous if subsequent testimony mentions it. But the conclusion of the administrative tribunal seems to me unassailable when the missing reference is one that is important for the purpose of establishing the difficulties encountered in the country he left. The incidents to which the applicant referred in the BOC Form were all incidents not involving him. The only one that implicated him was that of November 2014, and he did not mention it in his BOC Form. We are then faced with an incident where he was purportedly threatened and insulted, and where an attempt was made to hit him during a meeting in his village in November 2014. That is significant. It is in fact the only event that potentially involves him directly and demonstrates a real danger to him. In Zeferino v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 456, Justice Boivin, then of this Court, wrote at paragraphs 31 and 32 as follows: [31] This Court has confirmed on a number of occasions that all the important facts of a claim must appear in the PIF and that failing to mention them could affect the credibility of part or all of the testimony. Furthermore, the RPD is entitled to review the contents of the PIF before and after its amendment and may draw negative inferences about credibility if matters it considers important were added to the PIF by an amendment later (Taheri v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCT 886, [2001] F.C.J. No. 1252, at paragraphs 4 and 6; Grinevich v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (1997) 70 A.C.W.S. (3d) 1059, [1997] F.C.J. No. 444). [32] It was open to the panel to gauge the principal applicant\u2019s credibility and to draw negative inferences about the disparities between her statements in the original PIF, in the interview notes, in the amended narrative of the PIF and in the viva voce testimony, for which the principal applicant provided no satisfactory, plausible or credible explanation in the circumstances (He v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), (1994), 49 A.C.W.S. (3d) 562, [1994] F.C.J. No. 1107). In this case, and the Court agrees with counsel for the respondent, the evidence shows that the applicants\u2019 story and narrative changed over the last two years. (See also Odia v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 363, at paragraph 6 and Navaratnam v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 856, at paragraph 17). The effect of adding to the story is obvious. It is an attempt to embellish the story to include a more personal element to personalize the persecution. The other incidents reported did not have this element of personal persecution, although obviously the applicant was able to reflect on it since his refugee protection claim was made several months after arriving in Canada. It is difficult to see how this could be an oversight. [15] The failure to claim refugee protection soon after his arrival in Canada is also puzzling, even if this fact is not determinative of the issues and its relative weight is not significant. In Amrane v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 12, Justice No\u00ebl wrote: [31] The Federal Court of Appeal has recognized that the fact that a person does not seek asylum at the first opportunity is a factor that indicates that the person does not have a genuine subjective fear (Huerta v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 157 NR 225 at para 4, 1993 CarswellNat 297 (FCA)). Similarly, in Pepaj v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 938, Justice Rennie, then of this Court, wrote: [15] The Board was entitled to impugn the applicants\u2019 credibility based on the applicants\u2019 delay in claiming refugee status, and their failure to claim at the first opportunity: Toma para 18; Mahari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 999 at para 27. The applicants submit they have a reasonable explanation for the delay and failure to claim; however, the only explanation provided was that the applicants \u201cwanted\u201d to come to Canada for its \u201cvery good refugee protection\u201d. This is not an explanation that justifies the applicants\u2019 failure to claim in the numerous safe countries they travelled through. It was therefore reasonable for the Board to conclude that the applicants\u2019 behaviour was inconsistent with the fears alleged. The respondent concedes that this difficulty alone would not have been sufficient to conclude that there was no credibility. I agree. It is also true that the delay was not outrageously long. This is simply one more element to be considered by the administrative tribunal in reaching its conclusion. In its decision in Vavilov, the Court did not abandon the deference owed to an administrative tribunal, but rather announced that the analysis should henceforth be centered on the reasonableness of the decision, which should be first and foremost the purpose of the analysis. Thus, we read in paragraph 93: [93] An administrative decision maker may demonstrate through its reasons that a given decision was made by bringing that institutional expertise and experience to bear: see Dunsmuir, at para. 49. In conducting reasonableness review, judges should be attentive to the application by decision makers of specialized knowledge, as demonstrated by their reasons. Respectful attention to a decision maker\u2019s demonstrated expertise may reveal to a reviewing court that an outcome that might be puzzling or counterintuitive on its face nevertheless accords with the purposes and practical realities of the relevant administrative regime and represents a reasonable approach given the consequences and the operational impact of the decision. This demonstrated experience and expertise may also explain why a given issue is treated in less detail. Benefitting from the deference of the Court, I have come to the conclusion that the RAD\u2019s decision, since that is the one before the Court, cannot be characterized as unreasonable in light of the evidence in the case. The decision is justified. Its reasoning is inherently consistent and took into account the concerns of the applicant. [16] The test continues to be one of reasonableness, not of the decision the Court would otherwise have made. A reviewing court must develop an understanding of the decision maker\u2019s reasoning process in order to determine whether the hallmarks of a reasonable decision are present\u2014justification, transparency and intelligibility\u2014\u201cand whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision: Dunsmuir, at paras. 47 and 74; Catalyst, at para. 13\u201d (Vavilov, para 99). [17] It is important to remember that the Supreme Court confirmed the rule that there is a threshold for declaring a decision unreasonable. Not just any minor shortcoming can give rise to judicial review. In paragraph 100 of Vavilov, we read: [100] The burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable. Before a decision can be set aside on this basis, the reviewing court must be satisfied that there are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency. Any alleged flaws or shortcomings must be more than merely superficial or peripheral to the merits of the decision. It would be improper for a reviewing court to overturn an administrative decision simply because its reasoning exhibits a minor misstep. Instead, the court must be satisfied that any shortcomings or flaws relied on by the party challenging the decision are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable. [Emphasis added.] This brings me to the last argument. [18] The applicant made much of the error allegedly made by the RPD when it examined the baptismal certificate presented by the applicant. Since the RPD\u2019s decision is not before this Court, the applicant therefore complained that the RAD did not correct the error. In fact, the RAD said nothing about it. [19] It is clear that the RPD was mistaken in seeing a typing error or a spelling error when there was none on the baptismal certificate presented in evidence before the RPD. As the applicant noted, it is simply a font that can be misleading until one compares the letter that had allegedly been mistakenly typed with other similar letters in the same text. [20] However, the RAD made no mention of it since the RAD did not rely on what was obviously an RPD error; the complaint made to the RAD is that it did not specifically recognize the error made by the RPD. Some comments are called for here. First, the RPD made only peripheral use of what it believed to be a mistake. No conclusions were drawn: at best, the RPD pointed out that it could be a document of convenience. But the decision instead concludes that it is the lack of credibility, the poor quality of the testimony at the hearing, the omission from the BOC Form of the incident involving the applicant and the ignorance of the religion that the applicant claims to practise that are fatal (RPD Decision, paras 30\u201331). In the end, the RAD did not have to use the baptismal certificate because it was clearly satisfied that the other elements of analysis could not lead it to uphold the ultimate decision seeing that the applicant\u2019s version the lacked credibility, as did the RPD. I share that opinion. The RPD\u2019s error had no bearing on its decision. In any event, it is the RAD\u2019s decision that concerns the Court, not that of the RPD. The complaint made to the RAD for not having reported the error has no bearing. There are no \u201cserious shortcomings\u201d. If there was a shortcoming, it would have only been superficial and incidental. At most, we should say that the RPD\u2019s error, which was not expressly corrected by the RAD, is not one that warrants judicial review in the face of the other, much greater, difficulties of the applicant. [21] The Court therefore concludes that the RAD\u2019s decision was reasonable in that it was justified, transparent and intelligible. There is no question to be certified under section 74 of the Act, as the parties agree.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200121 Docket: IMM-2198-19 Citation: 2020 FC 86 Ottawa, Ontario, January 21, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Manson BETWEEN: SRISHTI SURI Applicant and MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Introduction [1] This is an application for judicial review of a visa officer\u2019s [the Officer] decision refusing the Applicant, Srishti Suri\u2019s application for a study permit. The Officer found the Applicant inadmissible to Canada pursuant to paragraph 40(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] for directly or indirectly misrepresenting a material fact that would have induced an error in administering the IRPA. II. Background [2] The Applicant is a citizen of India. On November 2, 2018, she submitted an application for a study permit to complete a Post Graduate Business Certificate at the Algoma University School of Business and Economics in Sault Ste. Marie. [3] As part of her application, the Applicant submitted a Guaranteed Investment Certificate [GIC] from Scotiabank as proof that she had sufficient available resources to finance her studies in Canada. [4] On January 30, 2019, an officer at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada [IRCC] sent the Applicant a procedural fairness outlining concerns that the Applicant may be inadmissible for misrepresentation. The letter states that the GIC submitted by the Applicant was verified and confirmed fraudulent. [5] On February 4, 2019, the Applicant\u2019s father responded to the procedural fairness letter. He explained that the Applicant did not prepare the financial documents herself, but paid a travel agent in India to do so. The family gave the travel agent cash. In return he provided them with the GIC, claiming to have deposited the cash with the bank in Canada. The Applicant then submitted the GIC as part of her study permit application. After finding out the GIC was fraudulent, the Applicant\u2019s father tried to contact the travel agent, but was unable to reach him. III. Decision Under Review [6] In a letter dated March 7, 2019, the Officer refused the Applicant\u2019s study permit application. The letter states that the Applicant was found inadmissible to Canada pursuant to paragraph 40(1)(a) of the IRPA for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of the IRPA. The letter further states that the Applicant will remain inadmissible to Canada for five years from the date of the letter, pursuant to paragraph 40(2)(a) of the IRPA. [7] The Global Case Management System [GCMS] notes for the file state that the GIC submitted by the Applicant was verified and confirmed fraudulent/non-genuine. The reviewing officer expressed concern that had the GIC been assessed as genuine, it could have led the officer to conclude that the Applicant had the financial resources to pay for her studies and accommodation in Canada, thus satisfying section 220 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR]. The reviewing officer noted that the response to the procedural fairness letter was thoroughly and carefully considered, but they were not satisfied that IRCC\u2019s misrepresentation concerns were satisfactorily disabused. The reviewing officer forwarded the file to a delegated decision maker for review. [8] The final, conclusory GCMS entry is brief, and reads as follows: Based on the notes of the reviewing officer and available information, on a balance of probabilities, I am satis\ufb01ed that subject has made a misrepresentation in the application, which would have induced an error in the administration of the Act, as explained by the reviewing of\ufb01cer. Subject was advised of our concerns and has failed to credibly disabuse them. As such, based on all available information, I am satis\ufb01ed that the applicant is inadmissible for misrepresentation under subsection 40(1)(a) of the Act. IV. Issues [9] The issues are: (1) Did the Officer breach the duty of procedural fairness in processing the Applicant\u2019s study permit application? (2) Was the Officer\u2019s decision reasonable? V. Standard of Review [10] The parties filed their memoranda prior to issuance of the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decisions in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] and Bell Canada v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66. [11] The Applicant made no submissions on the standard of review. The Respondent submitted that discretionary decisions of visa officers are reviewable on the reasonableness standard (Odutola v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 1352 at para 9). [12] The Court sent a direction to the parties giving them the opportunity to submit additional written representations on the standard of review and application of that standard. The Respondent and Applicant made representations by letter dated January 10, 2020. [13] Pursuant to Vavilov, when a court is reviewing the merits of an administrative decision, the presumptive standard of review is reasonableness (Vavilov, above at para 23). The Supreme Court identified two types of situations where this presumption can be rebutted (Vavilov at para 32). In the present case, the presumption is not rebutted, and I see no reason on the facts to deviate from the appropriate standard or the application of that standard. The standard of review for the Officer\u2019s decision is reasonableness. [14] The standard of review for issues of procedural fairness remains unchanged (Vavilov at para 23). When reviewing whether the Officer complied with the duty of procedural fairness, the standard is correctness (Mission Institution v Khela, 2014 SCC 24 at para 79). VI. Relevant Provisions [15] Pursuant to paragraph 40(1)(a) of the IRPA, a permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible for misrepresentation for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of the IRPA. [16] If a permanent resident or foreign national is determined to be inadmissible for misrepresentation outside Canada, they continue to be inadmissible for misrepresentation for a period of five years following the final determination of inadmissibility under subsection 40(1) (IRPA, s 40(2)(a)). [17] Pursuant to section 220 of the IRPR: An officer shall not issue a study permit to a foreign national, other than one described in paragraph 215(1)(d) or (e), unless they have sufficient and available financial resources, without working in Canada, to (a) pay the tuition fees for the course or program of studies that they intend to pursue; (b) maintain themself and any family members who are accompanying them during their proposed period of study; and (c) pay the costs of transporting themself and the family members referred to in paragraph (b) to and from Canada. VII. Analysis A. Did the Officer breach the duty of procedural fairness? [18] The Applicant submits that the Officer did not inform the Applicant how the GIC was verified, or who verified the GIC as fraudulent. Further, the Officer did not ask the Applicant to produce additional documentation to show that she had sufficient financial resources to study in Canada. The Applicant submits that the duty of procedural fairness required the Officer to give the Applicant effective notice and an opportunity to respond to the Officer\u2019s specific concerns. [19] The Respondent submits that it is unclear how the Applicant\u2019s ability to respond to the fairness letter was compromised by the Officer not stating in the procedural fairness letter that Scotiabank had confirmed that the GIC was invalid. [20] I agree with the Respondent. There is no breach of procedural fairness where the applicant is given a reasonable opportunity to respond to the case against her, particularly where the applicant takes advantage of this opportunity (Liu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 440 at para 12). In this case, the Officer informed the Applicant that the GIC was confirmed to be fraudulent. This was the only detail of the study permit application the Officer was concerned about, and the Applicant was given an opportunity to respond. The Applicant took this opportunity, responding by way of a letter drafted by her father to explain that she received the GIC documentation from a travel agent. However, the Applicant did not address the fraudulent nature of the GIC. [21] While the procedural fairness letter did not ask the Applicant to provide further documentation establishing that she had sufficient financial resources to study in Canada, this was not necessary. The letter gave the Applicant the opportunity to \u201cmake any representations\u201d in response to the letter. Had the Applicant wished to submit further documentation, she could have done so. B. Was the Officer\u2019s decision reasonable? [22] To determine whether the decision was reasonable, this Court must ask whether the Officer\u2019s decision \u201cbears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2013 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2013 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov at para 99). The Applicant bears the burden of satisfying the Court that there are significant shortcomings sufficiently central to the decision to render it unreasonable (Vavilov at para 100). [23] The Applicant submits that the GCMS notes simply state that the Officer reviewed and considered the Applicant\u2019s response to the procedural fairness letter, but do not state exactly why the Officer was not satisfied with the Applicant\u2019s response. The Applicant argues that the Officer should have considered the Applicant\u2019s response in light of her strong educational background and statement of purpose explaining her desire to study in Canada. [24] The Officer had an obligation to review the record in its entirety (Shao v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 610 at para 37). However, the Officer\u2019s focus on the fraudulent GIC document is warranted given the requirement in section 220 of the IRPR that an officer shall not issue a study permit unless the applicant establishes that they have sufficient financial resources to carry out their studies. Regardless of whether the Applicant satisfied the other requirements of the IRPA and the IRPR, absent satisfaction of section 220 of the IRPR, the Officer could not issue a study permit. Furthermore, the GCMS notes specifically state that the Officer made their decision \u201cbased on all available information.\u201d [25] Finally, the Applicant argues that there was sufficient documentation before the Officer to conclude that the Applicant was a bona fide student and that there was a reasonable explanation for the fraudulent GIC. As noted above, documentation supporting the Applicant\u2019s student status was considered by the Officer, but was not relevant to the Officer\u2019s determination that the Applicant was inadmissible for misrepresentation pursuant to paragraph 40(1)(a) of the IRPA. [26] While the Applicant explained that the fraudulent GIC was provided by her travel agent, the Applicant is ultimately responsible for all materials in her study permit application. An error or misrepresentation made by her travel agent does not bar the application of paragraph 40(1)(a) of the IRPA (Cao v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 450 at para 31). [27] It is unfortunate that the consequence of this misrepresentation is a five year ban on admissibility, but the Applicant failed in her duty of candour. The Officer\u2019s decision was reasonable.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : MC010401 MC010402 / MC010403 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Christian Camilo S\u00e1nchez Moreno (Principal Appellant) and Isabella Berm\u00fadez Angulo, Alejandro Angulo Moreno (Associate Appellants) are citizens of Colombia. They fear a gang who killed Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno\u2019s brother in 2016. The murderer was convicted and subsequently threatened Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno. The RPD dismissed their claim on the basis of credibility. The Appellants allege that the interpretation and Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno\u2019s mental health condition created breaches of natural justice. DECISION The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) to be redetermined. NEW EVIDENCE The evidence presented by the Appellants is accepted According to the law, I can only accept evidence that: arose after the RPD decision; or was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it. The Appellants have provided one piece of new evidence: a psychological report for Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno. This report is admitted. This report was prepared on December 16, 2020 (after the RPD decision). The Appellants concede that the report was not available in the circumstances and argue that Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno\u2019s testimony was affected by undiagnosed mental health conditions. I am satisfied that this report could not have been expected in the circumstances to have been before the RPD before the decision. The report also contains new evidence and is relevant to assessing the credibility of Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno. I find that the report is credible based on its preparation by a certified Canadian psychologist, its use of standardized tests and multiple interviews. The Appellants are requesting an oral hearing under subsection 110(6) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). This subsection provides that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is new evidence that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal; that is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. This subsection is discretionary given the term \u201cmay\u201d. This subsection is also conjunctive: all three elements must be present before a hearing may be held. In this case, I have found that there is admissible new evidence which relates to the credibility of the Principal Appellant. However, this evidence is not central to the decision and would not, in itself, justify the determination of the claim. I find that there is no jurisdiction for the RAD to hold an oral hearing. Further, in this case, the Appellant\u2019s Appeal is being sent back to the RPD for determination where the Appellant\u2019s evidence will be thoroughly assessed in the context of a review of the entire evidentiary record that was before the RPD. For these reasons, the request for an oral hearing is denied. ANALYSIS My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. The Appellants argue the following errors: Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno was unable to testify coherently due to undiagnosed mental health conditions during the audience; The interpretation was inexact and ineffective; The RPD did not understand or appreciate the facts of their allegations. The RPD made negative credibility findings on the following facts: Omissions: Death threat received on November 8, 2017, from a man at the Appellants\u2019 door was not mentioned in the BOC. Death threat received by phone on January 30, 2018 was not mentioned in the BOC. Contradictions: Appellant made a police complaint on June 26, 2019 as he \u201cwill be found in 10 days\u201d. BOC says there were multiple threats from the imprisoned murderer but oral testimony says that there was one comment communicated by a neighbour who visited the prison. Appellants moved to Cali from Candelaria for safety but the Appellant couldn\u2019t remember his address in Cali and continued to work in Candelaria. Appellant testified that he decided to leave Columbia at the end of September but obtained visas at the beginning of August. Appellant testified that he decided to leave Columbia at the end of September but made a request for police protection at the end of June. This request also refers to the Candelaria address and omits threats from 2017 and 2018. Interpretation I note that, from the beginning of his testimony, Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno was asked to wait for the interpretation before responding. The Appellant was also instructed at the beginning of the hearing about responding directly to the questions by the RPD member and by his counsel and reminded of this point on multiple occasions. I note that the Appellants\u2019 counsel interjected to assist in clarifying the question to the Appellant or corrected the interpreter about dates. The standard for errors of interpretation indicates that interpretation is not required to be perfect. The Chief Justice of Canada wrote the following: However, it is important to keep in mind that interpretation is an inherently human endeavour which often takes place in less-than-ideal circumstances. Therefore, it would not be realistic or sensible to require even a constitutionally guaranteed standard of interpretation to be one of perfection. In Mohammadian, the Federal Court of Appeal stated that \u201cthe interpretation provided to applicants before the Refugee Division must be continuous, precise, competent, impartial and contemporaneous.\u201d Interpretation need not be perfect: it must, however, be adequate. In order to sustain a finding of procedural unfairness, \u201cthe Applicant must show that there are serious, non-trivial problems with the interpretation.\u201d \u201cThe Applicant is not required to demonstrate that an interpretation error underpins a key finding if they can establish that there was a real and significant interpretation error.\u201d The case law reminds us that errors of interpretation must be more than negligible importance. Having listened to the audio recording, I find that there were some errors in interpretation which underpin key findings. Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno is asked to explain why he got American visas at the beginning of August 2019 before deciding to leave Columbia at the end of September 2019. It is only after the counsel and the son intervened to clarify the term \u201cvisa\u201d that Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno explains that he initially intended to take a holiday. The counsel interjects to observe that the Appellants did not understand the word being used for \u201chistory\u201d, although she doesn\u2019t ask for questions to be re-asked or ask questions herself. I note that this error in interpretation does not explain the other inconsistencies and omissions in Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno testimony about the visas. On the other hand, several contradictions and omissions were a result of Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno\u2019s testimony. I find that the Appellant is disingenuous to completely attribute the negative decision to the difficulties with interpretation. For example, Mr. Moreno is asked to explain why his narrative doesn\u2019t include a death threat received at his front door in November 2017: he relates that there were two court appearances as the person accused of his brother\u2019s death was first found not guilty, and finally responds that he doesn\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t include that detail in his account. He is asked why his narrative says that there were multiple threats from the imprisoned murderer of his brother but his oral testimony says that there was only one which is a third or forth hand account given to him by his neighbour. Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno is enjoined by his counsel and the RPD member to answer the question at 0:49:00. (It is at this point that the participants understand that Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno was using a colloquial expression of \u201ceight days is not a long time\u201d, which had been literally interpreted as a period of time and therefore identified as a contradiction by the RPD Member). Ten minutes later, he had to be again reminded to answer the question. He still does not answer the question and his counsel interjects to ask if he is understanding the question. Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno inability to respond to direct questions and his inability to address the focus of the question are errors which cannot be attributed to interpretation. To be clear, I find there is no error by the RPD member for his conduct of this challenging hearing. I find that, of the findings upon which the RPD based its decision, items 3 and 7 as set out in paragraph 8 above can be most clearly attributed to problems of interpretation. Once these are removed, there remains sufficient items upon which to make a decision. I am not satisfied that the difficulties in interpretation would be sufficient on their own to warrant a new hearing. Psychological condition The Appellants argue that Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno\u2019s testimony was affected by undiagnosed mental health conditions. I have listened to the audio hearing. For several items, the Appellant is asked a direct question (for example, is this the first time that you received a death threat?) and he does not answer the question until the RPD reminds him to do so. For example, the Appellant asked three times to describe what happened when he received death threats by phone. The psychological report also indicates that Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno had the same pattern at his interview with the psychologist: \u201cSes r\u00e9ponses ne sont pas toujours concr\u00e8tes, il prend du temps pour r\u00e9pondre aux questions ou parle avant de se faire questionner et a la tendance \u00e0 \u00e9viter rentrer dans les d\u00e9tails, souvent importantes ou reli\u00e9s \u00e0 son v\u00e9cu \u00e9motionnel. Il a fallu insister avec des questions directes et des techniques d\u2019entrevue sp\u00e9cifiques pour des situations de trauma pour avoir des pr\u00e9cisions. \u00bb The states that \"some degree of mental disturbance is frequently found in persons who have been exposed to severe persecution.\" People who appear before the IRB frequently find the process difficult for various reasons, including language and cultural barriers and because they may have suffered traumatic experiences that resulted in some degree of vulnerability\u2026\u2026 Guideline 8 on proceedings with vulnerable persons \u201caddresses difficulties that go beyond those that are common to most persons appearing before the IRB.\u201d The psychological report concludes that Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno suffers from PTSD. The report was based on three interviews and standardized tests for PTSD, anxiety and depression. The psychologist concluded that he may have experienced some periods of dissociation during the hearing. While some of the symptoms noted by the psychologist are common to many claimants, the psychologist found that Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno\u2019s condition was notable: \u201cdifficult\u00e9s d\u2019adaptation reli\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019immigration et l\u2019int\u00e9gration au Qu\u00e9bec et la d\u00e9valorisation professionnelle font en sort que les sympt\u00f4mes de M. S\u00e1nchez Moreno soient de nature chronique et d\u2019intensit\u00e9 mod\u00e9r\u00e9e avec une souffrance cliniquement significative\u201d. I am satisfied, based on the psychological report that Mr. S\u00e1nchez Moreno's difficulties go beyond the regular difficulties experienced by people who appear before the Commission, although I do not believe that they rise to the level of a designation as a vulnerable person. I am also satisfied that the omissions and contradictions identified by the RPD may have been affected by the medical condition identified by the psychologist. REMEDY Once the conclusions which were affected by interpretation are removed, there is sufficient evidence left on the record for the RAD to confirm the determination of the RPD or to make a new determination. However, the psychological report leaves a number of credibility concerns which still must be addressed, and the RAD is not able to substitute its own determination. The RAD could not hold an oral hearing and, even if the RAD could, then it would have to re-hear evidence that the RPD already heard. For these reasons, I cannot substitute my own determination for that of the RPD, nor find the Appellants to be Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The IRPA provides that I may refer the matter back to the RPD if, in my opinion, the RPD decision is wrong in law, in fact or in mixed law and fact and that I cannot make a decision without hearing evidence that was provided to the Refugee Protection Division. The test is conjunctive. In this claim, the RPD was wrong in fact due to undiagnosed medical conditions. In addition, I find that I am unable to make a decision without hearing evidence about the kidnapping threats, the actions of the Appellants prior to leaving Columbia and the subjective fear of the Appellants. For those reasons, I find that the appropriate remedy is to refer this claim back to the RPD pursuant to section 111(2) of the Act. CONCLUSION The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the RPD to be redetermined. DIRECTIONS TO THE RPD The claim will be heard by a differently constituted panel.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Christian Camilo S\u00e1nchez Moreno', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 28, 'end': 32}, {'text':

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200121 Docket: IMM-3131-19 Citation: 2020 FC 90 Winnipeg, Manitoba, January 21, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Madam Justice Strickland BETWEEN: GABRIEL OLADELE ABOLUPE Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] This is the judicial review of a decision by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), dated April 29, 2019, confirming the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), pursuant to s 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA), and concluding that the Applicant is neither a Convention Refugee nor person in need of protection pursuant to ss 96 and 97 of IRPA, respectively. Background [2] The Applicant, Gabriel Oladele Abolupe, is a citizen of Nigeria. He claimed refugee protection in Canada based on his alleged sexual orientation. [3] In his Basis of Claim form, the Applicant claimed that in February 2016, he attended a party with his boss, with whom the Applicant was in a same-sex relationship. The host of the party was later arrested because of his sexual orientation. In a raid of the host\u2019s home, the police found photos of the partygoers, including the Applicant. Having been tortured, the host confessed that all of the partygoers were all either gay or bisexual. In late March 2016, the Applicant confessed to his wife that he was bisexual, and fled his home to stay with a friend. [4] The Applicant alleges that after he left Nigeria in August 2016, the police frequented his home and asked his wife for his whereabouts. Further, that they informed his wife that the Applicant had engaged in a same-sex relationship and showed her the photos from the party where the Applicant is pictured. [5] The RPD denied the Applicant\u2019s refugee claim in a decision dated May 29, 2018. The RPD found that the determinative issues were credibility and the Applicant\u2019s sexual orientation. It concluded that there was insufficient evidence to establish the Applicant\u2019s sexual orientation on a balance of probabilities and that the Applicant\u2019s credibility was impugned. As such, the RPD found that the Applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor person in need of protection. [6] The Applicant appealed the negative RPD decision, however, the RAD dismissed the appeal and confirmed the decision of the RPD. This is the judicial review of the RAD\u2019s decision. Decision under review [7] The RAD noted that the Applicant\u2019s testimony was that, while in hiding for 5 months with his friend, the Applicant continued to work as head of operations in a major Nigerian bank. The RAD found that it was not consistent that the Applicant would claim to be in hiding yet continue to work at a public place, and that this was a central flaw in the Applicant\u2019s account of events in Nigeria. The Applicant\u2019s story that he continued to work daily at the same bank where he had worked for the prior 12 years, after being identified as a member of the LGBTIQ community, without being found by the police, weighed against a finding in support of the Applicant\u2019s account of events and his claim that he had been identified as a member of the LGBTIQ and that police were seeking him. The RAD concluded that this was central to the Applicant\u2019s claim, that it undermined his credibility, and that it was an implausible story. The RAD also found that although the Applicant\u2019s friend deposed that the Applicant stayed in the friend\u2019s home, the Applicant testified that he slept in a car, which was also an inconsistency. [8] The RAD found that there were also other concerns which, while they may not have been as significant as the Applicant\u2019s claim about being in hiding, also weighed against his credibility. Specifically, concerning the Applicant\u2019s marriage certificate, the RAD noted that the Applicant\u2019s home address on the marriage certificate was inconsistent with his Schedule A Form; the dates of birth for the Applicant and his wife did not match up with their ages as stated on the certificate; and, that the Applicant provided inconsistent testimony as to the date of their marriage. [9] The RAD addressed the affidavits the Applicant submitted from his wife and from his friend, again noting that the Applicant\u2019s claim that he continued to work at the bank after the police had identified him as having been involved in same sex activities was not consistent with his statements that the police were still looking for him. The RAD also referred to Immigration and Refugee Board Response to Information Requests (RIRs), in which sources state that people in Nigeria are unlikely to swear to another person\u2019s membership in the LGBTIQ community. The RAD also noted that country condition documentation indicates that fraudulent affidavits are easily available in Nigeria. In this context, the RAD afforded the affidavits little weight and found that they did not provide sufficient evidence to address the flaws in the Applicant\u2019s testimony. It also noted that the affidavit of the Applicant\u2019s friend was inconsistent with the Applicant\u2019s account of events. [10] Because of these and other stated concerns, the RAD found that there was insufficient credible evidence to find that the Applicant\u2019s narrative of events in Nigeria was credible and had occurred. [11] As to whether the Applicant had residual claim, the RAD assessed two letters from the Metropolitan Community Church (MCC), an affidavit from a man in Canada with whom the Applicant is allegedly in a relationship, pictures of two men together, and a letter of support from the 519 Community Centre (519 Centre) in Toronto. In sum, the RAD found that the evidence was vague and, even when considered on a cumulative basis, it was not sufficient to establish that it was more likely than not that the Applicant is a member of the LGBTIQ community. [12] Further, because the Applicant had failed to establish that he faced more than a mere possibility of persecution, there was also insufficient evidence to support his claim that he was a person in need of protection pursuant to s 97 of the IRPA. Issues [13] The Applicant identifies two issues, being that the RAD erred in its credibility assessment and in its assessment of his residual claim. In my view, these issues are subsumed within the over arching question of whether the RAD\u2019s decision was reasonable. Standard of review [14] Subsequent to the parties filing their written submissions, the Supreme Court of Canada issued its decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (Vavilov) in which that Court revisits the standard of review applicable to administrative decisions. Accordingly, at the hearing of this application for judicial review, I inquired if the parties wished to make any additional submissions arising from Vavilov and concerning the standard of review applicable in this matter. [15] Counsel submitted, and I agree, that reasonableness continues to be the appropriate standard of review for this Court when assessing the merits of the RAD\u2019s decision. [16] Vavilov established a presumption that reasonableness is the applicable standard whenever a Court reviews an administrative decision (Vavilov at paras 16, 23, 25). That presumption can be rebutted in two types of situations. The first being where the legislature explicitly prescribes the applicable standard of review or where it has provided a statutory appeal mechanism from an administrative decision to a court. The second being when the rule of law requires the application of the correctness standard. This will be the case in certain categories of questions, namely, constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, questions regarding jurisdictional boundaries between administrative bodies, or any other category that may subsequently be recognized as exceptional and also requiring review on the correctness standard (Vavilov at paras 17, 69). [17] The majority in Vavilov held that, \u201cit is the very fact that the legislature has chosen to delegate authority which justifies a default position of reasonableness review\u201d (Vavilov at para 30). In this matter, the presumptive reasonableness standard applies because the RAD has the delegated authority to make the decision under review and because none of the circumstances exist which might rebut the presumption. [18] The Supreme Court in Vavilov also addressed how a reasonableness review is to be conducted by a reviewing court (paragraphs 73-145). In that regard, it held that \u201c[i]n order to fulfill Dunsmuir\u2019s promise to protect \u2018the legality, the reasonableness and the fairness of the administrative process and its outcomes\u2019, reasonableness review must entail a sensitive and respectful, but robust, evaluation of administrative decisions: para. 28\u201d (Vavilov at para 12). The reviewing court must consider the outcome of the administrative decision in light of its underlying rationale in order to ensure that the decision as a whole is transparent, intelligible and justified (Vavilov at para 15). And, when a decision is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and is justified in relation to the facts and the law that constrain the decision maker it be reasonable and is to be afforded deference by a reviewing Court (Vavilov at para 85). Analysis The Applicant\u2019s testimony [19] The Applicant submits that the RAD\u2019s finding that it was implausible for the Applicant to continue to go to work for 5 months if the police were searching for him ignored his sworn testimony. The Applicant testified that he left his friend\u2019s home early in the morning (approximately 4:30 am) and returned at midnight to avoid detection by the police. Further, that his friend did not disclose to the police where the Applicant worked. The Applicant asserts that the RAD missed this evidence, and that it should have benefited from the presumption of truth (Maldonado v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1980] 2 FC 302 (CA)(QL/Lexis) (Maldonado)). [20] The Respondent submits that the RAD did not ignore evidence that the Applicant evaded the police by going to work early. Further, that the RAD acknowledged the Applicant\u2019s evidence that his friend did not disclose the Applicant\u2019s place of employment to the police. However, the RAD\u2019s finding was that it was reasonable to expect that if the police were looking for the Applicant then they would easily have located him at his place of employment. [21] I note that Maldonado states that when a refugee applicant swears to the truth of certain allegations that they are presumed to be telling tell the truth. Maldonado qualified this, however, by saying that this is so unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness (Maldonado at para 5; Adebayo v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2019 FC 330 at para 37). Thus, the presumption is rebuttable, for example, when the evidence is inconsistent with the applicant\u2019s sworn testimony or where the decision maker is unsatisfied with the applicant\u2019s explanation for those inconsistencies (Lawani v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 924 at para 21 (Lawani). [22] As to implausibility: [26] Finally, the RPD is also entitled to draw conclusions concerning an applicant\u2019s credibility based on implausibilities, common sense and rationality. It can reject evidence if it is inconsistent with the probabilities affecting the case as a whole, or where inconsistencies are found in the evidence (Shahamati v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] FCJ No 415 (FCA) (QL) at para 2; Mohamed v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1379 at para 25; Yin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 544 at para 59; Lubana at para 10). A finding of implausibility must however be rational, sensitive to cultural differences and clearly expressed (Rahal v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 319\u2026at para 44). The RPD\u2019s conclusions and inferences on a claimant\u2019s credibility must always remain reasonable and the analysis must be formulated in \u201cclear and unmistakable terms\u201d (Hilo v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1991), 130 NR 236 (FCA) [Hilo] at para 6; Cooper at para 4; Lubana at para 9). Situations where implausibility findings can be made include where the applicant\u2019s testimony is outside of the realm of what could reasonably be expected, or where the documentary evidence demonstrates that the events could not have taken place as alleged. Conversely, merely casting a \u201cnebulous cloud\u201d over the reliability of the evidence will be insufficient, as the RPD must state why credibility is affected in more than vague and general terms (Hilo at para 6). (Lawani at para 26) [23] In my view, against this legal backdrop and given the evidence in the record, there is no merit to the Applicant\u2019s submission that the RAD erred in its treatment of his testimony. [24] First, the RAD found that the Applicant\u2019s testimony that he slept in a car to avoid detention was inconsistent with the affidavit evidence of his friend, who deposed that the Applicant stayed in his house while in hiding. This serves to rebut the presumption that the Applicant\u2019s evidence was truthful. [25] Further, the Applicant submits that the RAD ignored his evidence that, to avoid detection by the police the Applicant left to go to work very early in the morning and returned very late at night. However, the RAD stated that it had conducted an independent assessment of the evidence and arguments, including review of the RPD hearing transcripts provided by the Applicant and listening to portions of the recording of the hearing. Nor do the reasons given for a decision have to include all the arguments, statutory provisions, jurisprudence or other details the reviewing judge would have preferred (Vavilov at para 91). [26] In any event, and more significantly, the fact that the Applicant left for work early and came back late was not relevant to and does not address the RAD\u2019s plausibility finding. The RAD reasonably found that it was inconsistent and implausible that the Applicant, who claimed he was in hiding from the police who were searching for him because he had been identified as a member of the LGBTIQ community, would continue to go to the same job at the bank that he had held for the prior 12 years for another 5 months until he fled Nigeria. The RAD found that it was improbable that in a country that is intolerant of members of the LGBTIQ community, and in a circumstance where the Applicant testified that the police were so intent on finding him that they had continued to search for him and had gone to his home looking for him on at least 3 occasions, that the Applicant would expose himself to the risk of being caught by the police by continuing to go to work each day in a public place after he was exposed to the authorities as a member of the LGBTIQ community and after he claimed to be in hiding. [27] The RAD also found that it was not probable that the police would not be able to locate the Applicant\u2019s place of work and apprehend him there. The RAD found that the Applicant\u2019s explanation to the RPD, when confronted with this, was that he had slept in a car. The RAD found that this did not explain how the Applicant could attend work daily for months without any authority finding him and that it was not reasonable to expect that someone who was hiding from the authorities would travel hours to go to the same place of work that he had worked at for years given the risk that he would be traced to his place of work. [28] In my view, the RAD\u2019s implausibility finding was reasonable as the Applicant\u2019s testimony defied common sense and was outside of the realm of what could reasonably be expected in the prevailing circumstances. The Applicant\u2019s continued daily attendance at work at the bank was also put to the Applicant and was not reasonably explained by him. I see no error in the RAD\u2019s conclusion that this gave rise to a negative credibility finding that was central to the Applicant\u2019s claim. The marriage certificate [29] The Applicant submits that the inconsistencies related to the date of his marriage, his home address, and the inaccuracy of the transcript he provided were insignificant and the RAD erred by failing to give the Applicant an opportunity to make submissions on those issues. Further, that the RAD should not have drawn an adverse credibility finding based on the inaccuracy of the transcript because the Applicant did not prepare the transcript. Making a conclusion that the transcript was not accurate amounts to impermissible speculative reasoning. [30] The Respondent submits that there were inconsistencies in the marriage certificate that reasonably undermined the Applicant\u2019s credibility. And, contrary to the Applicant\u2019s submissions, the Applicant was given an opportunity to respond to those inconsistencies. The Respondent also disputes that the RAD was merely relying on peripheral inconsistencies. [31] The Federal Court of Appeal in Armson v Canada (Employment and Immigration), 9 Imm LR (2d) 150, [1989] FCJ No 800 (CA) (QL/Lexis) held that a decision maker should not draw adverse credibility findings unless evidence is either contradicted, inconsistent, or inherently suspect. Further, this Court has held that adverse credibility findings should not be based on inconsistencies that are peripheral to an applicant\u2019s claim (Lubana v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FCT 116 at para 11 (FCTD); Lawani at para 23). [32] Here, however, and as discussed above, the RAD reasonably found that the Applicant\u2019s evidence about going into hiding was central to his claim, being that he is a bisexual man who is being sought by the Nigerian police, and was not credible. Further, the RAD explicitly acknowledged that the other inconsistencies in the Applicant\u2019s evidence were as not as significant as the Applicant\u2019s evidence about being in hiding, but found that that they also weighed against his credibility. Thus, these were secondary credibility concerns and were identified as such by the RAD. For example, as to the inconsistent dates of birth for the Applicant and his wife and their ages as between the marriage certificate and the Applicant\u2019s testimony, the RAD weighed the alleged error in marriage certificate dates \u201cin the context of other errors that weigh against the Applicant\u2019s credibility\u201d. Further, the Applicant submitted the marriage certificate as documentary evidence supporting his claim, which included that the police had gone to his home and advised his wife that the Applicant was involved in a same sex relationship and that the police were seeking his whereabouts. Given this, inconsistencies about the date of his marriage and his home address were relevant to the assessment of the credibility of his claim as a whole. The RAD considered the evidence in whole and did not dismiss the Applicant\u2019s claim based on peripheral inconsistencies. [33] The RAD also noted that there was an inconsistency in the Applicant\u2019s testimony about the date of his marriage. At the RPD hearing, he testified that he was married on April 24, 2012. When the RPD pointed out that this was not consistent with his marriage certificate, which indicated that the date of his marriage was April 21, 2012, the Applicant testified that he thought he had stated the latter date. The RAD noted that the RPD had accepted this as a plausible explanation. However, despite this, the Applicant had continued to argue the point before the RAD, quoting transcripts that he had provided that state he had testified that he was married on April 21, 2012. The RAD found, having listened to the recording of the RPD hearing, that it was clear that the interpreter stated April 24, 2012 and that there had been no objection to the translated date. The RAD went on to say that it was unclear why the Applicant was raising the issue, given that the RPD had accepted his explanation. However, as he had raised it, the RAD pointed out that his transcript was not accurate on the point. The RAD found that the Applicant may not have been clear in his testimony and this may not have been a significant point, however, it was confirmation that there were errors in the transcripts and that this also did not enhance his credibility. [34] The Applicant submits that the RAD was wrong to have made a negative credibility finding on its \u201cassumption that the transcript submitted was not accurate\u201d and failed to consider that the transcript was not prepared by the Applicant but by \u201ca certified personnel\u201d. Further, that making a conclusion that the transcript was not accurate amounts to speculative reasoning, which is not a legitimate basis upon which a credibility finding can be made. [35] In my view, these arguments are also of no merit. The RAD did not assume that the transcript submitted by the Applicant was inaccurate. The RAD compared the transcript to the actual recording of the RPD hearing and found that it was inaccurate. Moreover, it was the Applicant and his counsel who caused the transcript to be prepared and submitted. The fact that the Applicant now asserts that it was not him, but an unidentified \u201ccertified personnel\u201d who prepared it, does not change the fact that he was responsible for the document that he submitted. Nor does he actually assert that his version of the transcript was, in fact, accurate. In this circumstance, I do not agree with the Applicant that the RAD erred in failing to provide him with an opportunity to be heard on this point. The recording and the inaccurate transcript spoke for themselves. [36] Nor is it clear that the RAD actually drew an adverse credibility inference based on the inconsistency with the transcript submitted by the Applicant. Rather, the RAD found that the submission of an inaccurate transcript did not enhance his credibility, which it had already found to have been negatively impacted by his evidence as to a central aspect of this claim, going into hiding. [37] Additionally, I note that the Applicant does not contest the RAD\u2019s finding that when asked by the RPD about the difference in the Applicant\u2019s home address as between his marriage certificate and his application, the Applicant responded that houses are normally renumbered and that this could probably be the explanation. When asked if his house had been renumbered, the Applicant responded only to say that houses are renumbered a lot. The RAD found that this was not a reasonable explanation given that the Applicant had lived in his home for 4 years and that it was more likely than not that he would remember whether his home was renumbered. The supporting affidavits [38] The Applicant submits that the RAD erred by discounting the affidavits of his wife and his friend on the basis that, in Nigeria, it is unlikely that someone would swear an affidavit to another\u2019s LGBTIQ status (Gbemudu v Canada (Citizenship, Refugees and Immigration), 2018 FC 451 at para 81(Gbemudu)). The Applicant also submits that the prevalence of fraudulent documents in Nigeria does not mean that all documents are fraudulent and should not be assessed on their merits (Gbemudu at para 79). Rather, the affidavit evidence creates a presumption of truth and that the RAD should have relied on the affidavits. The Applicant submits that the RAD erred by relying on the generalization as to the availability of fraudulent documents and in failing to assess the affidavits for their worth and with an open mind. [39] The Applicant also submits that his wife\u2019s affidavit establishes that the police in Nigeria now believe the Applicant to be bisexual, which is a criminal offence in Nigeria, and seek to arrest him. He submits that this goes to his risk upon return as he is now perceived to be a bisexual. [40] The Respondent submits that the RAD did not dispute whether it was possible for a family member or friend to swear an affidavit to someone else\u2019s LGBTIQ status. Rather, the RAD merely commented on the likelihood that someone would swear such an affidavit and that Gbemudu is distinguishable. Nor did the RAD reject the affidavits based on the fact that fraudulent documents are widely available in Nigeria. The RAD assessed the affidavits in light of its overall finding that the Applicant\u2019s story lacked credibility. The Respondent submits that the RAD was entitled to give no weight to evidence that merely corroborates a story already found to be not credible. Further, that it was reasonable for the RAD to rely on an Immigration and Refugee Board RIR when assessing the weight to be given to affidavit evidence (Ikheloa v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1161 (Ikheloa)). [41] I note that, with respect to the supporting affidavits, the RAD stated that it had considered the evidence supporting the Applicant\u2019s claim. This included two affidavits from the Applicant\u2019s wife stating that the Applicant told her that he was a bisexual and that the police are still looking for him. The RAD again noted that the Applicant\u2019s claim that he remained in Nigeria for 5 months and worked in the same place after the police knew of his bisexuality was not consistent with the statements that the police are still searching for him. The RAD also noted that the record contained a RIR in which sources confirm that it is unlikely that someone would swear an affidavit regarding another person\u2019s membership in the LGBTIQ community. Further, that there are also two other RIR\u2019s that address the likelihood of an affidavit where someone in Nigeria swears to a person\u2019s membership in that community. In the second of these, a source reported that it would be very unusual for a barrister to swear such an affidavit and that the majority of the sources indicate that it is unlikely that a person would swear to another person\u2019s membership in the LGBTIQ community. The RAD stated that it had weighed all of the available evidence and found that it was more likely than not that it is unusual for an affidavit in Nigeria to be sworn on this issue. And, even if the Applicant\u2019s wife swore the affidavit, the RAD must still weigh the content of it in the context of all of the evidence on record. On that basis, the RAD gave the affidavit little weight. [42] The RAD also noted that fraudulent documents are easily available in Nigeria and, considering the affidavits in the context of the evidence on rampant forgery, the RAD was unable to give them weight. Nor did the affidavits provide sufficient evidence to address the flaws in the Applicant\u2019s evidence. [43] As to the affidavit of the Applicant\u2019s friend, the RAD again noted that it was unlikely that anyone in Nigeria would swear such an affidavit, that fraudulent affidavits are widely available and that the affidavit was inconsistent with the Applicant\u2019s account that he slept in a car while the friend deposed that the Applicant stayed in the friend\u2019s house. The RAD stated that RIR reference sources indicate that it is not a standard practice in Nigeria for a Commissioner of Oaths to swear an affidavit regarding a person\u2019s gender or sexual orientation. [44] A review of the RAD\u2019s reasons and the record that was before it demonstrates that the RAD referenced RIR NGA105379.E, dated January 7, 2016, which concerns whether a Commissioner of Oaths or a notary public would notarise a statement or swear an affidavit in which an individual admits to being a bisexual, or to knowing of someone\u2019s sexual orientation. The RIR states that other sources indicated it would be strange for a person to swear to an affidavit about sexual orientation because this would amount to reporting themselves under Nigerian laws, which make homosexuality illegal. As to family members making such an affidavit, a source gave an opinion that the situation would be the same as that of an individual seeking an affidavit about sexual orientation \u2013 that this would be unusual and amount to reporting the person to the law. Family members would be unlikely to swear such an affidavit, but may be more willing if the LGBTIQ individual was guaranteed absolute confidentiality or security. RIR NGA105653.E, dated November 18, 2016, also speaks the unlikelihood of a barrister or solicitor would swear to such an affidavit and was referenced by the RAD. [45] In this regard, the Applicant submits that the fact that a person would be unlikely to swear an affidavit to show another person\u2019s membership in the LGBTIQ community does not means it is impossible, and that the RAD made an assumption and selectively used evidence to support this assumption. Further, that it is a settled principle that family members can depose an affidavit in support of their bisexual family member\u2019s claim. [46] In my view, this argument cannot succeed. First, the RAD was entitled to rely on the RIRs and, unlike Ikheloa, here the Applicant submitted no opinion or other evidence intended to bring into question the reasonableness of that reliance (Ikheloa at paras 20-22). Second, the RAD accurately stated that the majority of the sources referenced in the RIRs indicated that it was unlikely that individuals, who are members of the LGBTIQ community, or their family members, would swear affidavits deposing to the sexual orientation of such individuals because it would put the individual at risk. The RAD made no assumptions and did not selectively use the RIR evidence. Moreover, the onus was on the Applicant to establish that it was more probable than not that such an affidavit would be sworn. The mere fact that it was not impossible for the Applicant\u2019s wife and friend to swear such an affidavit does not meet that burden. Further, while the Applicant submits that the affidavit was only intended to be used in Canada, as the Respondent points out, the risk arises from the making of the affidavit in Nigeria, not where it will be used. [47] I am also of the view that Gbemudu, relied upon by the Applicant, does not assist him. While in that case, in analysing the RIR 105653.E, Justice Russell stated his view that the information contained in the RIR seemed hypothetical and skeptical that such an affidavit would be necessary, and that he could not find any instances where individuals had been punished for swearing an affidavit (Gbemudu at para 81), Justice Russell ultimately found that the RIR was not relevant to the application before him. This was because the affiant in that instance was promised confidentiality, the affidavit was only for use in the proceedings in Canada, and the affiant did not actually swear knowledge of the applicant\u2019s sexuality (Gbemudu at para 81). Thus, Gbemudu is distinguishable on its facts. Here, the facts are more similar to Ikheloa given that the affiants, the Applicant\u2019s wife and friend, deposed actual knowledge of the Applicant\u2019s sexuality and there is no evidence that they sought or were guaranteed confidentiality. Like in Ikheloa, the RAD weighed the available evidence and concluded that it was more likely than not for an affidavit to be unusual. In my view, the RAD\u2019s analysis based on the RIRs was reasonable. [48] The RAD also considered the affidavits in view of the documentary evidence as to the availability of fraudulent documents and its other concerns with the affidavits, including that the affidavit of the Applicant\u2019s friend was inconsistent with the Applicant\u2019s version of events. In that context, the RAD afforded them little weight. [49] I agree that the easy availability of fraudulent documents in Nigeria does not mean that all documents from that country are fraudulent and, therefore, on that basis, the affidavits from Nigeria need not be assessed on their merits. However, it was open to the RAD to afford no weight to evidence which serves to corroborate a story already found not to be credible, which is the circumstance in this case (Lawani at para 24; Lawal v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 558 at para 22; Jia v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 422 at para 19). Here, the RAD found that the central aspect of the Applicant\u2019s claim lacked credibility, it was therefore entitled to afford little weight to affidavits presented to corroborate that version of events. Further, the RAD also assessed the supporting affidavits, finding that they did not provide sufficient evidence to address the flaws in the Applicant\u2019s evidence. [50] As to the Applicant\u2019s argument that the evidence establishes that he will be perceived as bisexual in Nigeria, the RAD found that the Applicant\u2019s narrative about what happened to him in Nigeria \u2013 being sought by the police because of his orientation \u2013 was not credible. In so finding, the RAD dispensed with any issues related to his bisexual identity and any perception of his sexual identity. Put otherwise, the RAD did not believe the central element of the Applicant\u2019s claim that the police in Nigeria were pursuing him because of his sexual orientation and therefore the RAD afforded the affidavit evidence little weight. Accordingly, this is not a case, such as Ogunrinde v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2012 FC 760, relied upon by the Applicant, where the evidence established that the authorities in Nigeria believed that the applicant therein was a homosexual and he was, therefore, at risk as a result of that perception. Residual claim [51] The Applicant submits that the letter from 519 Centre, the MCC letters, and the affidavit from the Applicant\u2019s same sex partner in Canada were unreasonably dealt with by the RAD. He submits that attendance at the MCC and at the 519 Centre demonstrates membership in the LGBTIQ community and the letters from those entities are probative evidence of sexual orientation. Further, that the affidavit from his same sex partner should have benefited from the presumption of truth found in Maldonado, and his partner\u2019s failure to testify at the RPD hearing should not diminish the weight or content of his evidence. [52] The Respondent takes the position that neither letter from the MCC nor the 519 Centre letter constitute evidence of the Applicant\u2019s sexual orientation. Further, the letter from the 519 Centre only states that the Applicant attended a meeting in October 2016. The Respondent submits that the RAD reasonably found that the affidavit from the Applicant\u2019s same sex partner was vague. He also did not appear to be questioned by the RPD. The Respondent submits that the RAD reasonably found that the affidavit did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that the Applicant is a member of the LGBTIQ community. [53] Here, the Applicant has submitted a letter of support from the 519 Centre, dated October 26, 2016 which states that the Applicant is a member and completed a newcomer orientation session in October 2016 and has since been attending and participating in weekly support group meetings and LGBTIQ related workshops. The RAD accepted that the Applicant had some involvement with the 519 Centre but noted that this could only have been for a few weeks, given that the letter was dated October 26, 2016. The RAD also noted that there was no updated evidence from the 519 Centre. The RAD acknowledged that the Applicant had testified that he had gone to a meeting the week before the hearing in April 2018, but found that there was still not a clear picture of the Applicant\u2019s actual level of activity with the 519 Centre. The RAD distinguished Leke v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 848 and Diallo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 562, which had been relied upon by the Applicant. The RAD also considered the affidavit from a man with whom the Applicant claims to be having a relationship in Canada, noting that it states that he and the Applicant attend the 519 Centre, but found that it was vague because it did not say how often they attended. Nor did the deponent come to the RPD hearing to afford the RPD an opportunity to question him. [54] The original MCC letter dated October 9, 2016 confirms that the Applicant attended the MCC seeking support for his claim to remain in Canada due to his sexual orientation. The letter states that he has attended since September 25, 2016, attended one monthly Refugee Peer Support meeting and showed an interest in volunteering. The letter goes on to say that by engaging with MCC the Applicant has shown his willingness and level of comfort in being a part of its community as a bisexual man. A more recent letter from MCC, dated February 11, 2018, states essentially the same thing, varied to the extent that it states that the Applicant has attended \u201cseveral\u201d monthly meetings and has volunteered his time and services at the MCC information centre. No information is provided as to how often this has occurred. The RAD addressed this evidence, as well as the Applicant\u2019s testimony that he usually goes to church at MCC. It also noted the affidavit evidence of the man with whom the Applicant alleges he is in a same sex relationship in Canada. The RAD found that the affidavit does not indicate the frequency of attendance, that the Applicant\u2019s testimony was vague, especially considered in the context of the later MCC letter. The RAD also found that the MCC letters did not provide an opinion as to the Applicant\u2019s sexual orientation. The RAD found that the MCC evidence was not sufficient to address the flaws with the Applicant\u2019s claim. As to the affidavit from the person said to be in a same sex relationship with the Applicant in Canada, dated January 30, 2018, the RAD also found this to be vague. [55] The RAD concluded that the evidence provided by the Applicant, including the 519 Centre letter and MCC letters, simply established he had some involvement or level of activity in the LGBTIQ community, but not that he was an active member. The RAD found the evidence to be vague as to the type, frequency and level of commitment to the organization. Further, that this was not a case where there was sufficient credible evidence of an applicant\u2019s membership in the LGBTIQ community to overcome a finding that the applicant\u2019s narrative was not credible. Further, that the Applicant\u2019s testimony as to his relationship in Canada, which would have been ongoing since December 4, 2016, was also vague and the deponent of that affidavit did not testify. The RAD found that, even on a cumulative basis the evidence was not sufficient to establish that it was more likely than not that the Applicant was a member of the LGBTIQ community. The evidence regarding his sexuality was vague and, even considering the supporting documentary evidence on it own merits, it was afforded little weight and it was not sufficient to establish that it is more likely than not that he is a member of the LGBTIQ community. [56] As a preliminary observation, while the RAD characterizes this part of its analysis as addressing the Applicant\u2019s residual claim, it is not residual in the sense that this aspect of the Applicant\u2019s claim concerned other or different alleged grounds of persecution. Rather, the RAD noted that the Applicant\u2019s position before it was that, simply because he may have lied about one part of his claim, it did not necessarily follow that his entire story was not credible and, in essence, he asked the RAD weigh the credible evidence against the other evidence. This appears to be the analytical approach taken by the RAD. [57] And while, in my view, it is possible to take issue with some points in the RAD\u2019s assessment, such as that the 519 Centre letter did, in fact, indicate the type of involvement of the Applicant, viewed in whole, the RAD\u2019s conclusion that the evidence as to the Applicant\u2019s sexual orientation was vague is supported based on a review of the evidence before it, which is found in the record. The onus was on the Applicant to establish the residual claim with convincing evidence. [58] Nor is this a situation such as Buwu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 850, relied upon by the Applicant. There, the applicant was not in a same sex relationship in Canada, and therefore, her evidence as to her active involvement in LGBTIQ communities was essential to her claim. Here, the Applicant claims to be in a same sex relationship in Canada and his evidence as to the extent of his involvement with the MCC and 519 Centre was limited and did not suggest an active role, as found by the RAD. Further, while such membership is one factor that may be considered by the RAD when assessing whether an applicant has established his or her claimed sexual orientation, it will seldom be sufficient on its own to establish this. [59] In this case, the Applicant claims to have been involved in a same sex relationship in Canada since December 2016. Yet, his own testimony and the affidavit of his alleged partner lacked detail concerning this relationship. His alleged partner\u2019s affidavit is brief. As to the relationship, its states the dates when he and the Applicant met and were first intimate, that they spend quality time together when they are free, they shop, worship at MCC and attend functions at the 519 Centre on Wednesdays. The affidavit essentially hits on the points raised by the Applicant, but provides no other insight or level of detail that might be expected to flow from a couple\u2019s day to day life together. This lack of detail potentially could have been cured had the Applicant\u2019s alleged partner attended to testify before the RPD as he indicated in his affidavit he was willing to do. The transcripts indicate, however, that the Applicant stated that the deponent did not attend the hearing held on April 16, 2018 because he has a new job, because of the nature of his work, because of his schedule and because they were short of staff. He did not attend the hearing held on May 29, 2018 because he had lost his father a month ago and he had been ill. There is no evidence that the Applicant sought an adjournment so that his alleged same sex partner could testify. [60] The RAD found that the supporting evidence was not sufficient to establish that it was more likely than not that the Applicant is a member of the LGBTIQ, which I take to mean that he had failed to establish his sexual identity and, therefore, that he would be at risk upon return to Nigeria. I see no reviewable error and, in effect, the Applicant is now asking this Court to reweigh the evidence, which is not its role (Qaddafi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 629 at para 59). Section 97 [61] The Applicant submits that notwithstanding its negative credibility findings, the RAD was obligated to consider whether objective country condition evidence established that he was at risk as a member of the LGBTIQ community. [62] The Respondent submits that the RAD found there was insufficient credible evidence that the Applicant was a member of the LGBTIQ community. Further, the RAD specifically addressed and reasonably concluded that the Applicant was not at risk pursuant to s 97. [63] Case law cited by the Applicant establishes that even though an applicant may not be credible, the underlying decision maker still needs to assess whether removal would subject the applicant personally to the risks stipulated in s 97 of IRPA (Odetoyinbo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 501 at paras 6-8 (Odetoyinbo)). Here, however, the Applicant\u2019s sexual identity is the basis for both his s 96 and s 97 claims. The RAD concluded that the Applicant was not a member of the LGBTIQ community on a balance of probabilities. It found that the burden of proof necessary to establish that a person is in need of protection pursuant to s 97 is higher than for establishing that one is a Convention refugee under s 96. As there was insufficient evidence to establish the risk under s 96, then it followed that there was also insufficient evidence to establish the same risk and that the Applicant was a person in need of protection under s 97. This is unlike Bastien v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 982, relied on by the Applicant, where the applicant\u2019s gender was an evident form of membership in a possibly persecuted group and was separate from her central claim (at paras 10-11), or Odetoyinbo where the RPD failed to make an explicit determination about whether the applicant was bisexual, and therefore erred in failing to conduct a separate s 97 analysis (at para 8). Here, the RAD made its conclusion that the Applicant had not established that he was a part of the LGBTIQ community before concluding that a s 97 claim grounded on the same risk was similarly not made out. No error as arises in its treatment of s 97. Conclusion [64] In conclusion, having considered the outcome of the RAD\u2019s decision in light of its underlying rationale, I find that the decision as a whole is transparent, intelligible and justified (Vavilov at para 15). Accordingly, the RAD decision was reasonable.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200113 Docket: IMM-1907-19 Citation: 2020 FC 33 Ottawa, Ontario, January 13, 2020 PRESENT: Madam Justice Simpson BETWEEN: GURPREET KAUR GILL Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS (Delivered orally from the Bench in Toronto, Ontario on December 10, 2019) [1] This application is for judicial review of a decision of the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board, dated March 1, 2019, [the Decision] in which the Panel Member dismissed the Applicant\u2019s appeal for want of jurisdiction because the Applicant filed an application for permanent residence while barred from doing so due to misrepresentation. This application for judicial review was brought pursuant to section 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA]. I. Background [2] The Applicant applied to sponsor her husband, Amandeep Singh Aujla [the Husband] as a permanent resident and the application was made in June 2016 [the Sponsorship Application]. [3] However, on November 18, 2015, the Husband had been found inadmissible for misrepresentation because he had submitted fraudulent bank documents in support of an application for a Temporary Resident Visa. [4] On March 31, 2017, an Immigration Officer [the Officer] refused the Sponsorship Application for two reasons. First, he was not satisfied that the Applicant and her Husband were in a genuine marriage not entered into primarily for the purposes of immigration and second, he found that the Husband was ineligible to apply for permanent residence for five years from November 18, 2015. [5] The Applicant appealed the Officer\u2019s decision to the IAD. II. Decision [6] The IAD found that it did not have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal of the Officer\u2019s decision to refuse the Sponsorship Application because the Husband was inadmissible for misrepresentation under section 40(1)(a) of the IRPA, and because section 40(3) of the IRPA applied. It states: 40(3) A foreign national who is inadmissible under this section may not apply for permanent resident status during the period referred to in paragraph 2(a). 40(3) L\u2019\u00e9tranger interdit de territoire au titre du pr\u00e9sent article ne peut, pendant la p\u00e9riode vis\u00e9e \u00e0 l\u2019alin\u00e9a (2)a), pr\u00e9senter de demande pour obtenir le statut de r\u00e9sident permanent. [7] The IAD accurately stated that there were no Federal Court decisions that consider the impact of section 40(3) on the right of appeal to the IAD. The IAD therefore referred to four IAD decisions that deal with the issue, acknowledging that while they were not binding, they provided guidance. These cases are Lefter v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 CanLII 10743 (CA IRB); Keays v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 CanLII 54764 (CA IRB); Dhillon v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 CanLII 102071 (CA IRB); and Josefina v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 CanLII 136419 (CA IRB) (referred to in the Decision as Delos Reyes). They all concluded that where the inadmissibility for misrepresentation predated the Application for permanent residence as in this case, there was no jurisdiction in the IAD to hear an appeal from an Officer\u2019s refusal of a Sponsorship Application. [8] In its decisions in Lefter and Dhillon, the IAD observed that notwithstanding section 40(3), if an Officer decided a Sponsorship Application, the IAD would have appellate jurisdiction. However, in its Decision the IAD noted that these statements were obiter dicta because in neither case, had the Officer in fact, made a decision. [9] The IAD therefore concluded that all four IAD cases support a finding that the IAD has no jurisdiction to consider an appeal where section 40(3) applies, even when, as in this case, an Officer has made a decision on an application for permanent residence. [10] To support its conclusion, the IAD reviewed the IRPA and its Regulations and determined that the fact that an immigration officer decides an application for permanent residence that should not have been filed does not create a right of appeal to the IAD. [11] The IAD found the following: Section 40(3) of the IRPA provides that a sponsored applicant who is inadmissible for misrepresentation may not apply for permanent resident status during the five year period referred to in section 40(2)(a). Filing a sponsorship application after the spouse is barred by section 40(3), is not in the prescribed form in accordance with Regulation 10(1), as the sponsorship application does not include a valid application for permanent residence. Regulation 10(6) then applies. It states \u201cA sponsorship application that is not made in accordance with subsection (1) is considered not to be an application filed in the prescribed manner for the purposes of subsection 63(1) of the Act\u201d. Further, Regulation 12 requires an officer to return the application for permanent residence for non-compliance. In addition, under section 15(1) of the IRPA, an officer is authorized to proceed with an examination of a sponsorship application only if a person makes an application to the officer in accordance with the IRPA. The IAD\u2019s Conclusion: where section 40(3) applies during the five-year period of exclusion for misrepresentation, the applicant is not permitted to make an application for permanent residence. This means that an application for permanent residence filed during that period is not made in accordance with the IRPA, and as such, an officer is not authorized to proceed with an examination of that person\u2019s application for permanent residence. [12] Lastly, the IAD considered Operational Bulletin 595 [OB 595]. It states: With the new subsection 40(3), a person is now ineligible to apply for permanent residence during the same period as the inadmissibility for misrepresentation. Therefore, any permanent residence application from a foreign national inadmissible under section 40 that is received within the five-year period of inadmissibility must be returned with the fees as it will not be examined. [13] The IAD finally concluded that by reason of the IAD decisions and section 40(3) of the IRPA, and OB 595, the IAD was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. III. The Issues [14] Since this application involves a Sponsorship Application which was made and decided by an Officer after the 5 year exclusion for misrepresentation was in place, I will deal only with the issues which arise on these facts. [15] Against this background the issues are: Do the IAD\u2019s statements in Lefter and Dhillon assist the Applicant? Did the IAD rely too heavily on OB 595? Did the IAD misconstrue section 15(1) and Regulation 10(6) of the IRPA? I will deal with each issue in turn. IV. Lefter & Dhillon [16] It is clear from the language that the IAD used in these cases that its statements were obiter. That being so, and given my view that an application filed contrary to section 40(3) is null and void ab initio, I am not persuaded that simply because an Officer mistakenly decides such an application, his or her mistaken decision gives the application life and creates a right of appeal. V. OB 595 [17] In my view, the IAD considered this bulletin to see whether it reinforced the decision it also reached based on the IAD\u2019s cases and the wording of section 40(3). This was a reasonable use of the bulletin. VI.

[. . .] Invalid sponsorship application Demande de parrainage non valide (6) A sponsorship application that is not made in accordance with subsection (1) is considered not to be an application filed in the prescribed manner for the purposes of subsection 63(1) of the Act. (6) Pour l\u2019application du paragraphe 63(1) de la Loi, la demande de parrainage qui n\u2019est pas faite en conformit\u00e9 avec le paragraphe (1) est r\u00e9put\u00e9e non d\u00e9pos\u00e9e. [19] In my view these provisions deal with two different issues. \u201cIn a prescribed manner\u201d appears to deal with matters of form and content and I am therefore not persuaded that the IAD was reasonable when it determined that Regulations 10(1) and 10(6) were helpful in reaching its Decision. [20] However, in my view this error was not material. Section 15(1) speaks of applications made \u201cin accordance with this Act\u201d and therefore, the IAD reasonably considered this provision in its analysis because section 40(3) makes it clear that the Sponsorship Application was not made in accordance with the Act. VII. Conclusion [21] Section 40(3) is determinative. The Sponsorship Application was a nullity as was the Officer\u2019s Decision. The IAD therefore had no valid decision to consider and reasonably determined in these circumstances that it had no jurisdiction. VIII. Certification [22] No question was posed for certification for appeal. JUDGMENT IN IMM-1907-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that the application for judicial review is dismissed. There was no question posed for certification. \"Sandra J.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200106 Docket: IMM-5253-18 Citation: 2020 FC 13 Ottawa, Ontario, January 6, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice James W. O'Reilly BETWEEN: MARY GRACE DE GUZMAN Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] Ms Mary Grace De Guzman, originally from the Philippines, arrived in Canada in 2016 on a visitor\u2019s visa. She travelled with her employers, who had engaged her in Dubai as a domestic worker. The employers claimed that they were spending two months in Canada on vacation. Soon after their arrival, the employers revealed that they planned to stay in Canada permanently. Ms De Guzman did not have a work permit. [2] In October 2017, Ms De Guzman left her job and went to live with an uncle in Vancouver. She moved from there into a residence for victims of human trafficking. She received therapy for symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). [3] Ms De Guzman filed a complaint against her employers with the BC Employment Standards Branch. She obtained a 180-day Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) as a Victim of Trafficking in Persons (VTIP) and a corresponding Open Work Permit (OWP). Her complaint was resolved on consent in 2018. [4] Ms De Guzman then went to work at a restaurant and applied for an additional VTIP TRP and OWP, or, in the alternative, regular residency and work permits. An immigration officer refused her requests, finding that it was reasonably safe and possible for her to return to the Philippines where she had worked before and had family support. The officer noted that Ms De Guzman would be protected there against any reprisals by her former employers. In addition, she had received the support of Canadian organizations for several months, including counselling, and a $16,500.00 settlement of her employment complaint. [5] With respect to her request for a regular residence and work permit, the officer found that there was no basis for granting them. Ms De Guzman had resolved the complaint against her former employers and, while she was also dissatisfied with her treatment at the restaurant, she had not filed any complaint against it. [6] Ms De Guzman submits that the officer\u2019s decision was unreasonable because it failed to take into account important evidence \u2013 her PTSD diagnosis and her allegations of mistreatment by her employers at the restaurant. She asks me to quash the officer\u2019s decision and order another officer to reconsider her application. [7] I agree with Ms De Guzman that the officer overlooked important evidence in her favour, resulting in an unreasonable conclusion. I must, therefore, allow this application for judicial review. II. Was the Officer\u2019s conclusion unreasonable? [8] The Minister maintains that the officer\u2019s decision was reasonable because there was no justification for additional permits as a VTIP. In addition, the officer did not overlook evidence that Ms De Guzman displayed symptoms of PTSD, or that she may have been exploited by her employers at the restaurant. The officer found that Ms De Guzman had received psychological counselling and had not filed any complaint against the restaurant. [9] I disagree with the Minister\u2019s submissions. [10] The officer recognized that Ms De Guzman had received counselling over a period of several months, and that she requested time for additional counselling. However, the officer did not assess the merits of Ms De Guzman\u2019s request for time for further counselling, or consider the availability of suitable counselling in the Philippines. [11] Further, in respect of the VTIP permits, the officer did not consider Ms De Guzman\u2019s allegations of abuse by the restaurant\u2019s employers or respond to her request for time to file a report against them. [12] Accordingly, the officer\u2019s conclusion was unreasonable on the evidence. III. Conclusion and Disposition [13] The officer, having overlooked important evidence, rendered an unreasonable decision on Ms De Guzman\u2019s applications. I must, therefore, allow this application for judicial review. Neither party proposed a question of general importance for me to certify, and none is stated. JUDGMENT IN IMM-5253-18 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that the application for judicial review is allowed, and the matter is remitted to another officer for reconsideration. \"James W.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200114 Docket: IMM-3589-18 Citation: 2020 FC 39 Ottawa, Ontario, January 14, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Pentney BETWEEN: X.Y. Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] The Applicant is a citizen of Ethiopia, who claimed refugee status in Canada. Her original claim was based on her fear of persecution by Ethiopian authorities because of her participation in an anti-government protest in 2016. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denied her claim. She appealed to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). [2] During her RAD appeal, the Applicant\u2019s refugee claim included her fear of persecution based on her political involvement, but she also claimed to fear persecution based on her HIV status and the lack of appropriate medical care because she is HIV-positive and has breast cancer. The RAD dismissed her appeal on July 9, 2018. The Applicant seeks judicial review of that decision. [3] At the hearing of the judicial review application, the Applicant sought an order to protect her anonymity, asking that the decision, and all other publicly available information in the Court records, be redacted to protect her identity. The Respondent opposed this request, and argued that the Applicant had not met the test for a confidentiality order. [4] I am satisfied that, having regard to the relevant principles set out in the governing jurisprudence, such a limited order is appropriate in this case. As will become clear below, the Applicant did not disclose her HIV status at the RPD hearing because she feared that she would face stigma within her community if this fact were to become known, and there is evidence of widespread discrimination on the basis of HIV status in Ethiopia. Such a limited order has been granted in other, similar cases: see, for example, AB v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 629; AB v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 165; AB v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 237. [5] The style of cause in this matter is amended so that the Applicant will be identified only by the initials X.Y . I. Context [6] The Applicant is a citizen of Ethiopia of Oromo ethnicity. She worked for the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the Ministry) during the 1990s and early 2000s, where she claims she faced discrimination due to her ethnicity. While deployed overseas, the Applicant made comments at her workplace that were critical of the government\u2019s treatment of people of Oromo descent in Ethiopia, and she alleges that this caused her dismissal by the Ministry. [7] She returned to Ethiopia, and claims that two Ethiopian police officers raped her in 2002. She believes that this assault resulted in her becoming infected with HIV. Since that time, she has experienced frequent discrimination in Ethiopia because she has HIV. [8] The Applicant states that in October 2016 she closed a kiosk she owned and operated to participate in a strike against the Ethiopian government, sometimes referred to as the Oromo uprising. Since then the authorities have been searching for her because she was perceived to be an opponent of the government. The Applicant claims she went into hiding at her sister\u2019s house, before fleeing to the United States on April 22, 2017. From there she arrived in Canada in August 2017 and submitted a refugee claim. [9] The RPD dismissed the Applicant\u2019s claim on the basis of credibility. It found her testimony to be lacking in detail and confused regarding certain key elements of her allegations, including the timing of her interactions with the police, as well as the circumstances of her departure from Ethiopia. Overall, the RPD did not find her allegations to be supported by the evidence, and it dismissed her refugee claim. It should be noted that the Applicant did not directly raise her claim based on her HIV status before the RPD because she feared that she would face stigma from her community if this were disclosed. [10] The Applicant appealed this decision to the RAD, and sought to introduce new evidence about: (i) her HIV status and a psychological evaluation report about her capacity to testify at the RPD hearing, (ii) the extent of discrimination against persons with HIV in Ethiopia, and (iii) updated country condition documents on the overall situation in the country. [11] The RAD accepted the first two categories of documents as new evidence. The RAD accepted the Applicant\u2019s explanation as to why she did not disclose her HIV status (although it noted that she did testify before the RPD that she had acquired a virus for which she was receiving retroviral therapy), and it also accepted that the Applicant had not disclosed to the RPD that her father had passed away only a few days before the RPD hearing, and that this had affected her capacity to testify. The RAD therefore accepted the evidence relating to the Applicant\u2019s personal situation as well as the documents regarding stigma and discrimination in Ethiopia related to HIV. [12] The RAD did not accept the more general country condition documents. It found that this evidence did not indicate a change in country conditions, but rather demonstrated ongoing unrest in the country, including the targeting of perceived opponents of the government and limits on basic rights and freedoms. The evidence before the RPD was that Ethiopia had been under a 10-month state of emergency beginning in October 2016, and the further evidence the Applicant wanted to file before the RAD simply pointed to a continuation of that state of affairs. [13] The RAD refused to convene an oral hearing, because it found the determinative issues to be the Applicant\u2019s credibility and her objective risk upon return, neither of which could be resolved with a hearing. [14] The Applicant claimed that the RPD denied her a fair hearing by relying on an inadequate and unreliable translation, which caused the RPD to make unfounded credibility findings, and by focusing on her allegation relating to rape, without considering her state of mind at the hearing. [15] The RAD rejected the argument based on the inadequacy of the translation, finding that while there were some issues with the quality of the translation, they were generally minor and there were substantial periods during the hearing where there appeared to be no problems with the translation. Despite the difficulties with the translation, the RAD found that the Applicant was able to relay her story. [16] The RAD then considered the Applicant\u2019s submissions regarding the RPD\u2019s credibility findings relating to the events associated with her return to Ethiopia, including the rape allegation. The RPD had drawn negative credibility conclusions about her inability to identify the times when she went to the police, but the Applicant argued that the errors in translation had contributed to the confusion and that the negative credibility findings were therefore incorrect. [17] The RAD found that the RPD\u2019s analysis was microscopic and unjustified. Based on the new evidence which provided context for the Applicant\u2019s inability to recall a specific date and time regarding traumatic events that took place approximately 15 years prior to her testimony, the RAD accepted the Applicant\u2019s allegations of rape and that she became infected with HIV as a result. It found the Applicant to be credible regarding these allegations, on a balance of probabilities. [18] The RAD did not accept that the RPD had become overly focused on the rape allegations or that it failed to consider the Applicant\u2019s state of mind during the hearing. It found that the hearing had proceeded in a manner that was respectful to the Applicant. Since the RPD had not been informed of the death of the Applicant\u2019s father shortly before its hearing, or provided with any expert evidence regarding her capacity to testify or to recall events, it could not be faulted for failing to consider the impact of these things. [19] Turning to the core of the Applicant\u2019s refugee claim that she was wanted by Ethiopian authorities, the RAD upheld the RPD\u2019s determination that she was lacking in credibility because she had been able to obtain a passport and visa. Furthermore, the Applicant had not obtained any corroborating evidence to support her claim and she had been able to leave Ethiopia through the airport using her own passport. The RAD concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support her claim that the authorities were looking for her. [20] The RAD\u2019s analysis of this aspect of the Applicant\u2019s claim largely replicates that of the RPD. It noted that her testimony that she had gone into hiding after she was told by an Oromo police officer and a neighbour that the security forces were looking for her was contradicted by her actions in applying for and obtaining an Ethiopian passport as well as a Unites States visa. The RAD concluded that her engagement with government agencies ran counter to her testimony that she was in hiding. [21] The RAD weighed the Applicant\u2019s testimony against her ability to procure a passport and visa, the absence of any corroboration of her claim, and the lack of any arrest warrant or summons. It concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support her allegation that she was wanted by Ethiopian authorities. The RAD also noted that the objective documentary evidence suggested that low-level opponents of the government (as opposed to higher-ranking leaders) were at a greater risk of detention. This also ran counter to her narrative about her departure from the country. [22] For all of these reasons, the RAD concluded that the Applicant was lacking in credibility with respect to the events of 2016 and her allegations that the security authorities in Ethiopia were looking for her. [23] The RAD also rejected the Applicant\u2019s claims based on her HIV status. It noted her evidence that she had been diagnosed while in Ethiopia and that she had received treatment by a doctor at a hospital there. While the objective country evidence referred to social stigma and discrimination against people with HIV or AIDS, the RAD noted that the Applicant\u2019s personal experience was not consistent with this. She had been receiving regular treatment, support and monitoring since her diagnosis. The RAD concluded that the evidence did not support a conclusion that the cumulative effect of discrimination amounted to persecution. Furthermore, the Applicant\u2019s experience showed that she had been able to live, work, and get treatment in Ethiopia. [24] For all of these reasons, the RAD dismissed the Applicant\u2019s appeal, and confirmed the RPD\u2019s determination that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. II. Issues and Standard of Review [25] The only issue in this case is whether the RAD decision is reasonable. This includes the questions raised by the Applicant about the RAD\u2019s treatment of the interpretation problems, its assessment of her claims about the events after October 2016, whether she has a residual profile that warrants protection, and about her fear of persecution because of her HIV status. [26] Prior jurisprudence has confirmed that the standard of reasonableness applies to the RAD\u2019s credibility findings as well as any matters of mixed fact and law: see Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93 at para 35; Rozas del Solar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1145 at para 25. This also applies to the RAD\u2019s consideration of whether the RPD hearing was procedurally fair: Gebremedhin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 497 at para 11 [27] When this case was argued, the leading authority on reasonableness review was Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir], and its progeny. I have reviewed the recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov]; Bell Canada v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66, and Canada Post Corp v Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67 [Canada Post]. In view of paragraph 144 of Vavilov, I see no reason on the facts of this case to request additional submissions from the parties on either the appropriate standard or the application of that standard. As stated in Canada Post at paragraph 26, under both frameworks the result in this case would be the same. [28] When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, Dunsmuir stated that the analysis was to focus on \u201cthe existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process\u201d and whether the decision \u201cfalls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law\u201d (Dunsmuir at para 47, and Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para 59). [29] Under the Vavilov framework, \u201cwhere reasons are provided but they fail to provide a transparent and intelligible justification\u2026 the decision will be unreasonable\u201d (at para 136). However, Vavilov also confirms that \u201cit is not enough for the outcome of a decision to be justifiable. Where reasons for a decision are required, the decision must also be justified, by way of those reasons, by the decision maker to those to whom the decision applies\u201d (at para 86, emphasis in original). Key elements in this analysis include whether the reasoning is rational and logical, and whether the decision is justified in relation to the relevant constellation of law and facts (Vavilov, paras 102 and 105). III. Analysis [30] The Applicant argues that the RAD made four errors: (i) it failed to address whether the translation errors at the RPD hearing affected its negative credibility findings; (ii) it made unreasonable findings regarding the post-October 2016 events; (iii) it failed to examine the Applicant\u2019s residual profile as an Oromo woman who had been critical of the government; and (iv) its findings about her HIV status are unreasonable because they were made without regard to the objective documentation. [31] These will be addressed in turn. A. Translation errors [32] The Federal Court of Appeal in Mohammadian v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCA 191, [2001] 4 FC 85 [Mohammadian], found that \u201cinterpretation provided to applicants before the Refugee Division must be continuous, precise, competent, impartial and contemporaneous\u201d (at para 4). The standard of interpretation is high, but does not need to be perfect; the key is whether there was linguistic understanding: R v Tran, [1994] 2 SCR 951. Put another way, the question is whether the individual was allowed to tell their story and to be understood: Batres v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 981 at paras 10-13 [Batres]. [33] However, if there are errors in translation which are demonstrated to be material to the RPD\u2019s credibility findings, the decision may be overturned: Batres at para 12; Huang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2003 FCT 326 at para 16. The errors must be serious, and they must have affected the individual\u2019s ability to answer questions. A key question is whether the errors were material to the tribunal\u2019s findings: Gebremedhin at para 14. If a breach of this standard is demonstrated, it is not necessary to show actual prejudice: Mohammadian at para 4; Batres at para 13. [34] The Applicant submits that the RAD did not engage with the essence of her argument on this point. She had claimed that the translation errors were material and affected the RPD\u2019s credibility findings. The Applicant points to portions of the transcript, which show that the translator made mistakes both in relaying the RPD\u2019s questions to the Applicant, and in translating her answers to key questions. The problems related, in particular, to the timing of her visit to the police station after her return to Ethiopia in 2002. The RPD made specific findings that the Applicant\u2019s narrative lacked credibility because she was unable to recall specific dates or to answer its questions about these events. [35] In addition, the Applicant points to portions of the transcript that show occasions when the translator went beyond the role of interpreting questions and answers, and tried to explain the underlying basis for a question or answer. [36] I am in agreement with the Applicant that the RAD\u2019s analysis of this issue is lacking, in that it does not address the key question from the jurisprudence: whether the translation errors affected the RPD\u2019s credibility findings in a material way. The difficulty for the Applicant on this point, however, is that the RAD rejected the RPD\u2019s findings on other grounds, and it ultimately concluded that the Applicant\u2019s claims were credible on a balance of probabilities. [37] The Applicant points to translation errors regarding her interactions with the police and her answers to questions on this issue. She also argues that the credibility findings regarding her treatment overseas, and upon her return to Ethiopia in 2002, reflected translation errors. The RPD did find her to be lacking in credibility in part based on her answers to these questions. However, the RAD found the RPD\u2019s analysis to be microscopic and unreasonable, and it reversed the findings on these specific points. It noted that these findings are not determinative, since the Applicant\u2019s refugee claim rests on the events that occurred after October 2016. [38] There is no evidence about any other translation errors relating to any other findings by the RPD. On the evidence before the Court, it is difficult to see how any error in addressing the translation issue affected the outcome in a way that is prejudicial to the Applicant. In light of this, I cannot accept that the inadequacies of the RAD\u2019s analysis of the translation issue are sufficient to render the decision unreasonable. B. The RAD\u2019s findings about the post-October 2016 events [39] The RAD found that the Applicant\u2019s narrative about the events that followed her involvement in the one-day strike in support of the Oromo uprising in October 2016 was not credible for three reasons: (i) she obtained a passport and visa while she was being sought by the authorities; (ii) the lack of corroborative evidence that she was in hiding undermined her credibility; and (iii) the Applicant was able to leave Ethiopia using her own passport, while the authorities were supposedly searching for her. [40] The RAD noted that the Applicant had said she went into hiding from October 2016 until she left Ethiopia in April 2017 because she was told by an Oromo police officer, as well as a neighbour, that she was wanted by the security forces. During this period the Applicant obtained an Ethiopian passport as well as a United States visa, both issued in February 2017. [41] The RAD noted that the RPD had examined the objective documentary evidence about the issuance of passports in Ethiopia, which indicates that both fingerprints and photographs are taken, and that it had found that her explanation for engaging with authorities and risking discovery by security agencies was not credible. The RAD concluded that the Applicant\u2019s testimony about being wanted by security forces ran counter to her actions in applying for and obtaining a passport and visa in person. Her engagement with government agencies during a period in which she said she was in hiding undermined her credibility. [42] The RAD also found the Applicant\u2019s credibility was impugned by the lack of corroborating evidence from the police officer or neighbor who told her she was wanted by the authorities, or from her sister with whom she had been in hiding for a period of six months. It also reviewed the documentary evidence regarding the ability of opposition members to leave Ethiopia. On the basis of all of this, the RAD concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support the Applicant\u2019s claim that she was wanted by the authorities. [43] The Applicant contends that the RAD\u2019s conclusions are not supported by the evidence and amount to implausibility findings. She argues that the RAD has found contradictions where none exist. The Respondent submits that the RAD\u2019s findings on these matters are supported in the evidence, and it is not the role of the Court to re-weigh the evidence. [44] I agree with the Applicant that the RAD\u2019s findings on her engagement with the authorities and her exit from Ethiopia amount to plausibility findings, because there is no true contradiction in the evidence. For example, the fact that Ethiopian passport authorities take fingerprints and photographs does not directly contradict the Applicant\u2019s story that she obtained a passport while she was in hiding. Rather, it raises a question as to why she would run the risk if she was truly wanted by security authorities. [45] The Applicant cites Tegene v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 787 [Tegene], where Justice George Locke set aside a decision of the RPD because its treatment of supposed inconsistencies in the testimony of the applicant was unreasonable. Specifically, Locke J. made the following findings: the RPD failed to consider the applicant\u2019s explanation for not seeking corroborative evidence from family members who were still in Ethiopia; she had testified that she did not want to put them in danger by asking them to comment on political issues because Ethiopian authorities were known to intercept such communications; the RPD misinterpreted her evidence about being in hiding, because she had never said she was in hiding all of the time. It was not inconsistent for her to have sought the assistance of a traditional healer, or to have left her home on occasion; she had stated that she left home regularly, and therefore the RAD erred in finding this to impugn her credibility; and the RPD found it implausible that the applicant had exited Ethiopia using her own passport, if she was actually being sought by the authorities; this finding was not justified by the evidence. [46] I agree with the Applicant that the Tegene decision is relevant and persuasive in relation to the specific findings made by the RAD in this case. Although there is evidence that Ethiopian passport authorities take fingerprints and photographs, there does not appear to be any evidence to demonstrate that this information is regularly or systematically shared with security forces. Furthermore, the RAD does not refer to the abundant evidence in the record regarding the difficulty that the passport authorities have in administering their system, and the gaps in information sharing which have been documented. [47] In addition, the RAD does not explain why it discounts the Applicant\u2019s evidence about why she did not seek out corroborative evidence from anyone in Ethiopia. Her explanation \u2013 that seeking such statement would put them at risk \u2013 is consistent with the objective documentary evidence, and with the finding in Tegene. [48] Similarly, the RAD\u2019s finding that the Applicant could not have left Ethiopia through the airport if she was actually wanted by the authorities is not supported by the evidence. The evidence does indicate that this may have posed a risk to the Applicant, but I agree with the statement of Locke J. in Tegene at paragraph 18, that the evidence \u201cgoes no further than noting a \u201crisk\u201d. It is inherent in a risk that the eventuality in question may not arise.\u201d [49] For these reasons, I find that the reasoning of the RAD on these questions is unreasonable. It does not reflect the binding jurisprudence that counsels against making implausibility findings except in the clearest of cases (Valtchev v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2001 FCT 776 at para 7), and in particular that credibility findings must be based on reasonably drawn inferences rather than conjecture or speculation (Kaur v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 757 at para 62). While it cannot be disputed that the role of the Court in reviewing a credibility finding is limited, for the reasons set out in Rahal v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 319, it is equally true that the Court has a supervisory role to ensure that the reasoning and analysis of the evidence is both justifiable and justified (see Vavilov, at para 86). [50] The findings of the RAD in relation to the Applicant\u2019s credibility are not explained in light of her testimony and the more general documentary evidence. The RAD has reached a number of conclusions by drawing inferences about what is reasonable or plausible, without explaining why it reached these findings based on the evidence in the record. This is not reasonable. C. The failure to consider the Applicant\u2019s residual profile [51] The Applicant contends that the RAD had an obligation to consider her residual profile as a dissenting Oromo who had expressed views in support of the Oromo minority and had criticized the government in her previous position in the embassy overseas. Once the RAD made credibility findings that were different from those made by the RPD, it had an obligation to consider the legal implications of these findings. [52] The Respondent submits that the RAD is limited to a consideration of the grounds of appeal that are argued before it. Here, the Applicant\u2019s focus was on the events that had occurred upon her return to Ethiopia in 2002, and then the events that followed her closing of her shop in October 2016. The RAD cannot be faulted for failing to analyze a ground of appeal that was not fully argued before it. [53] The Applicant\u2019s written submissions to the RAD mention the issue of her residual profile, noting that, \u201cgiven the deteriorating human rights situation in Ethiopia, particularly the recent round of crackdown [sic] on the Oromo community, the [Applicant] has a residual profile of a person who could be targeted by the government due to her imputed political opinion and Oromo ethnicity.\u201d The Applicant submits that the RAD\u2019s failure to analyze this ground renders the decision unreasonable. [54] I do not find that this aspect of the RAD\u2019s decision unreasonable. The Applicant points to the RAD\u2019s findings that differ from those of the RPD, but the difficulty for the Applicant is that these findings do not relate to her residual profile. It is not disputed that the Applicant is Oromo, and the RAD clearly considers the evidence she has brought forward about both her experience of persecution in Ethiopia, and her fears of returning. In the end, however, the RAD concludes that the evidence is simply insufficient to support her claims. At paragraph 39, the RAD concludes: \u201cWhile the evidence does refer to the ongoing human rights situation in Ethiopia, I find that the [Applicant] does not have a profile such that she would face a serious possibility of persecution if she were to return.\u201d [55] Although the analysis is not detailed, the decision does indicate that the RAD considered the Applicant\u2019s residual profile, but it was not persuaded that she was wanted by any agent of the Ethiopian government. There was no basis for it to find that her residual profile warranted refugee protection. D. Findings based on HIV status [56] The Applicant argues that the RAD\u2019s analysis of the new evidence regarding her HIV status is unreasonable because it ignored her evidence that she had experienced social stigma and discrimination while in Ethiopia. The RAD\u2019s conclusion that her own experience did not support a finding that she might face persecution in Ethiopia was made with reference only to some of the evidence, while ignoring other, directly contradictory, material in the record. [57] The RAD noted the Applicant\u2019s evidence that she had been diagnosed and received medical treatment on an ongoing basis while in Ethiopia. It referred to the objective country condition evidence about social stigma and discrimination, but found that this evidence did not support a conclusion that the cumulative effect of the discrimination rose to the level of persecution. Moreover, the RAD concluded that \u201cthe testimony of the [Applicant], her own personal experience, directly contradicts this evidence. The [Applicant] has been receiving regular treatment, support, and monitoring since her diagnosis in 2011\u201d (at para 37). [58] The Applicant submits that this is an unreasonable finding, because it does not refer to the Applicant\u2019s sworn affidavit before the RAD, which stated that she had experienced discrimination and stigma, and feared that she would experience violence because of her HIV status if she returned to Ethiopia. The Applicant stated that \u201cI was told I was not allowed to share food or utensils [or] hug others as I would transmit the virus to others. I became very anxious around people. I chose to isolate myself.\u201d This was not referred to by the RAD. [59] I find that the RAD\u2019s conclusion on this issue is unreasonable, given its failure to make any reference to the evidence of the Applicant on this particular point. The fact that she received medical care while in Ethiopia is relevant but not determinative. The RAD\u2019s conclusion that the Applicant \u201cwas able to live, work, and get treatment and mental health support in Ethiopia\u201d (at para 38) is contradicted by her evidence. The Applicant\u2019s evidence is also consistent with the abundant country condition documentation about the treatment of people with HIV or AIDS in Ethiopia (see XY v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 213). The RAD\u2019s failure to mention this aspect of the Applicant\u2019s evidence, combined with its specific finding quoted above that she was able to live and work in Ethiopia, makes it impossible to know whether the Applicant\u2019s evidence was discounted or ignored. This is not reasonable. IV. Conclusion [60] For all of these reasons, I find the RAD decision to be unreasonable. I am therefore granting the application for judicial review. The decision is overturned and the matter is returned to the RAD for reconsideration by a different panel. [61] There is no question of general importance for certification in this case. JUDGMENT in IMM-3589-18 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The style of cause is amended, with immediate effect, so that the name of the Applicant is replaced with the initials X.Y . The Application for judicial review is allowed. The decision of the Refugee Appeal Division is overturned. The matter is referred back to the Refugee Appeal Division for reconsideration by a different panel. There is no question of general importance for certification. \u201cWilliam F.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200128 Docket: IMM-2413-19 Citation: 2020 FC 32 Ottawa, Ontario, January 28, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Madam Justice St-Louis BETWEEN: JOHN ACHONA NATHANIEL Applicant and THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Introduction [1] Mr. John Achona Nathaniel seeks the judicial review of the decision rendered by the Immigration Division (ID) on March 27, 2019, which declared him inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the Act], and ordered his deportation under paragraph 229(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations SOR/2002-227. [2] The ID concluded there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Nathaniel was complicit in crimes against humanity committed by the Nigerian Police Force (NPF), by voluntary and knowingly making a significant contribution to the NPF crimes or criminal purpose. The ID also concluded there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Nathaniel knowingly and personally committed such crimes. [3] For the reasons set out below, the judicial review will be dismissed. II. Context [4] Mr. Nathaniel is a citizen of Nigeria. On August 18, 2017, he entered Canada and claimed refugee protection. [5] On August 25, 2017, Mr. Nathaniel signed the Schedule \u201cA\u201d form whereby indicating having worked for the SIB (State Intelligence Bureau) as a police officer from March 2000 to January 2017. [6] On September 6, 2017, Mr. Nathaniel signed his Basis of Claim form. In the narrative annexed to said form, he indicated, inter alia, having worked with the NPF as a \u201cPolice Officer in the State Intelligence Bureau Department of Lagos State Police Command, Ikeja\u201d, and that he feared for his and his wife\u2019s safety in Nigeria essentially because criminals against whom he fought as a police officer sought revenge. [7] On January 12, 2018, Mr. Nathaniel completed a form outlining the details of his police service. He then confirmed, inter alia, having served as (1) cell guard, holding the rank of constable, for about 4 years, participating in arrests and interrogations; (2) orderly in the MOPOL unit, holding the rank of corporal, for about 7 years, involved in the peace keeping in the Osun State; (3) commander in the scorpion special anti robbery squad (SARS) for 5 years, holding the rank of sergeant, bringing the arrested individuals to the office for interrogation under cautionary statements; and (4) coordinator SIB for 5 months, holding the rank of inspector, coordinating SIB in the Ajao Estate whereby arresting kidnappers and interrogating them under cautionary statement. [8] On February 7, 2018, an officer of the Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) interviewed Mr. Nathaniel who provided details, namely, on his work in the NPF, on the locations where he worked, and who confirmed having been promoted based on merit. [9] On February 24, 2018, an Inland Enforcement Officer prepared an inadmissibility report under subsection 44(1) of the Act. The Officer noted the information Mr. Nathaniel confirmed in his Basis of Claim force and in the January 12, 2018 document detailing his work in the NPF. The Officer also noted that the documentary evidence showed that police in Nigeria commits crimes against humanity, such as extrajudicial killings, torture, rape and extortion with relative impunity. The Officer concluded that there was reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Nathaniel was inadmissible under the article 35(1) of the Act for committing and act outside Canada that constitutes and offence referred to in sections 4 to 7 of the Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes Act SC 2000, c 24. [10] On October 2, 2018, a Minister\u2019s Delegate, having reviewed the Officer\u2019s report, deferred the file to the ID for an inadmissibility hearing, pursuant to subsection 44(2) of the Act. [11] On October 3, 2018 and on November 27, 2018, the ID heard the case, where Mr. Nathaniel testified, and on March 27, 2019, the ID rendered the decision challenged in these proceedings. III. Impugned decision [12] In its decision, the ID introduced the subject by noting the allegation under paragraph 35(1)(a) of the Act and the standard of proof found at section 33 of the Act. [13] The ID subsequently examined the facts, outlining the ones that are undisputed, and stated each parties\u2019 position. The Minister argued that the documentary evidence demonstrated that the NPF has committed crimes against humanity as defined internationally and in Canada. He added that Mr. Nathaniel should be declared inadmissible under paragraph 35(1)(a) of the Act because there are reasonable grounds to believe he was not only complicit to those crimes as a police officer in Nigeria, but because he also personally and directly committed extrajudicial assassination and torture, considered crimes against humanity internationally and in Canada. [14] The ID indicated that the Minister emphasized that (1) Police Order 237, i.e. the Rules for guidance in use of firearms by the police allows police in Nigeria to shoot suspects and detainees who attempt to escape or avoid arrest, and to shoot at rioters, and is a blanket provision for abuse and a sign of the institutionalisation of police violence; (2) the SARS is a limited brutal organization within the NPF; and (3) Mr. Nathaniel\u2019s credibility is greatly affected as it is unlikely that he would be unaware of the systematic and widespread violations and crimes against humanity perpetrated by the NPF. [15] The ID outlined Mr. Nathaniel\u2019s position that there is only one test to apply to determine inadmissibility for crimes against humanity, and it is the one set out in Ezokola v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 SCC 40 [Ezokola], not the one used by the Minister to impeach his credibility. In regards to the contribution test, Mr. Nathaniel argued that (1) the Minister overgeneralized and exaggerated the human rights violations in the documentary evidence, referring to the Minister\u2019s exhibit C-14 (Human Rights Watch, page 411, para 2) pointing out that there are many good Nigerian police officer; (2) a finding of inadmissibility was reached only by mere association or passive acquiescence, which is insufficient. Mr. Nathaniel added that (1) his testimony, both before the ID and during the interview with the CBSA officer, was fluid and without contradictions; (2) he, like his father and uncle, was a good cop, which caused him not to receive on-time promotions, to live in poverty and to be unable to afford to pay rent or provide for his wife\u2019s medical care; (3) the Minister excluded important details of his testimony in that he only shot at civilians in self-defence and that no torture was ever committed while he was guarding cells, in that interrogating suspects does not mean he tortured them, and in that participating in anti-riot operations does not mean he shot the protestors; (4) widespread corruption is irrelevant in assessing inadmissibility; (5) he did not know about the \u201cabattoir\u201d; (6) the fact that the SARS is widely believed to be responsible for extrajudicial executions is not based on evidence; (7) executions by the SARS occurred in Abuja state where he did not work; (8) the assertions that NPF is a brutal purpose organization and that all positions occupied by Mr. Nathaniel are problematic overgeneralizations; (9) the fact that he had been in the organization for seventeen years does not mean he knew the death penalty was a possible sentence for robbery nor that the Police Order 237 existed; and (10) the fact that some police officers may have committed crimes in a widespread and systematic manner does not mean that he should be responsible for them. [16] The ID found that there was no doubt Mr. Nathaniel was employed by the NPF, joined voluntarily, worked as a police officer from March 1st 2000 to January 2017, and was promoted a few times. [17] The ID also found there was reasonable grounds to believe that the NPF committed acts that fall under the definition of crimes against humanity, and that credible and trustworthy documentary sources attributed many crimes against humanity to the NPF in general and to specific units in which Mr. Nathaniel worked, namely the MOPOL, SARS, and SIB units, such as torture, rape, extrajudicial executions, death in police custody and other inhumane acts. The ID found inconceivable that Mr. Nathaniel was unaware of the crimes committed by those three units, and it specifically noted that Mr. Nathaniel testified having killed civilians after they opened fire at him and having personally interrogated many suspects of crime. The ID held that Mr. Nathaniel knew what was going on and that he tried to diminish his involvement, participation and knowledge of the atrocities during his testimony. [18] The ID essentially agreed with the Minister\u2019s assessment of the Ezokola factors. Hence, regarding the size and nature of the organization, the ID noted that the NPF was a policing organization with approximately 325,000 officers committing systematic, institutionalized, and widespread crimes against humanity with almost total impunity. Regarding the method of recruitment, the ID noted that Mr. Nathaniel joined the NPF voluntarily to follow his father and his uncles\u2019 footsteps, at the suggestion of a friend. Regarding Mr. Nathaniel\u2019s position or rank in the organization, the ID noted the contradiction between his testimony at the hearing and the declaration during the CBSA interview, gave more weight to the latter, and found that he had been promoted on merit. The ID concluded that Mr. Nathaniel made significant contribution to the NPF. [19] Regarding Mr. Nathaniel\u2019s duties and activities, the ID found that: (1) MOPOL is known as a kill and go unit; (2) Mr. Nathaniel worked for MOPOL for seven years; (3) Mr. Nathaniel was posted in Ikeja for the SARS and conducted highway arrests, mass arrests and brought suspects into offices for interrogation; (4) Ikeja is one of the police facilities where atrocities occurred according to documentary evidence; (5) Mr. Nathaniel worked in the SIB; (6) systematic torture, inhumane acts by the SIB, and deaths in custody are commonplace; and (7) 80% of inmates in Nigeria claim to have been beaten by police, threatened with weapons and tortured in police cells. The ID outlined Mr. Nathaniel\u2019s roles in stopping people at roadblocks, shooting civilians during police operations, interrogating detainees and guarding cells, and concluded that these actions, duties and responsibilities were a significant contribution in the crimes against humanity attributed to the NPF and its criminal purpose. [20] Regarding knowledge of the organization\u2019s atrocities, the ID agreed with the Minister that the NPF committed widespread and systematic crimes against humanity, and that it is inconceivable that Mr. Nathaniel was unaware of the crimes committed daily by his colleagues or of the PO237, concluding to the contrary that Mr. Nathaniel knew what was going on. The ID therefore concluded that Mr. Nathaniel lacked credibility and was attempting to conceal his knowledge of what was happening at that time around him. [21] Regarding the length of time in the organization, the ID noted that Mr. Nathaniel was a member of the NPF for a long period of 17 years, was promoted a few times on merit, and there was thus an increased chance that he knew of the NPF\u2019s crimes or criminal purpose as well as the significance of his contribution. Regarding the opportunity to leave the organization, the ID concluded that Mr. Nathaniel voluntarily remained in the NPF. Ultimately, the ID concluded, based on these factors, that Mr. Nathaniel voluntary and knowingly made a significant contribution to the NPF crimes and criminal purposes and was thus inadmissible. [22] The ID then examined whether Mr. Nathaniel personally committed crimes against humanity. The ID gave more weight to the details Mr. Nathaniel provided to the CBSA officer than to his testimony before the ID, and concluded there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Nathaniel had personally executed actions that constitute crimes against humanity while working for the MOPOL, the SARS or the SIB. IV. Position of the parties A. Mr. Nathaniel [23] Mr. Nathaniel submits that in applying the Ezokola contribution-based approach to the facts of the case at bar, the ID made erroneous findings of fact that the Applicant was complicit in crimes against humanity committed by the NPF and knowingly and personally committed such crimes, and therefore, erroneously applied the test reaching the wrong conclusion. [24] Mr. Nathaniel first addresses the nature of the NPF. He essentially submits that, contrary to the ID\u2019s conclusion, the NPF is before everything, a police organization that investigates, fights crimes, makes arrests, and interrogates suspects in a very violent and criminalized country. He namely points to exhibit 14 where it is outlined that many Nigerian police officers conduct themselves in an exemplary manner, and that there exists control mechanisms, and to exhibit 9, where it outlines police reform in Nigeria in 2000. He further submits the ID erred in concluding that the NPF had a limited brutal purpose, save for the SARS. [25] Mr. Nathaniel then addresses his contribution to the NPF. He first argues that the ID\u2019s conclusion on his credibility stems from its error to treat the NPF as an organisation with limited brutal purpose, excerpt SARS, and that it should have concluded that Mr. Nathaniel only engaged in ethical work. [26] He submits that the test for complicity requires a voluntary, knowing and significant contribution to the crime or criminal purpose of a group, which is not fulfilled in his case. He adds that he had not committed a criminal act, nor did he have the criminal knowledge or intent of committing one. He also argues that even if he did have knowledge of the crimes, the requirement of his significant contribution to the crime or criminal purpose of a group was not demonstrated. [27] Mr. Nathaniel submits that the ID failed to properly apply the Ezokola factors and to make proper findings based on the evidence. He adds essentially that (1) the ID failed to consider there were good police officers, and to explain why it excluded Mr. Nathaniel from the good officers in the NPF; (2) the ID failed to properly analyze his duties and activities within the organization, and whether there is a link between his duties and activities with the crimes and the criminal purposes of the organization; (3) the ID erred in challenging his testimony based on information in external sources; (4) having knowledge of the organization by being member for a substantial period of time does not mean he made a significant contribution to the crimes or to the criminal purposes. B. The Minister [28] The Minister submits that the ID properly applied the test enunciated in Ezokola v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 SCC 40: complicity rests on a \u201cvoluntary, knowing and significant contribution to the crime or criminal purpose of the group alleged to have committed the crime\u201d (at paras 36, 92). The Minister reviews the Ezokola factors and responds namely that (1) the ID did not conclude that the entirety of the national police had a limited, brutal purpose, and specifically outlined a lack of evidence to show the SARS had such a purpose, there is substantial evidence that the MOPOL, SARS and SIB committed crimes against humanity at the time when Mr. Nathaniel served in these organizations, and the passage cited by Mr. Nathaniel arguing there were good cops is engulfed in a paragraph highly critical of the NPF; (2) Mr. Nathaniel did join voluntary; (3) Mr. Nathaniel did confirm he had been promoted on the basis of merit (applicant\u2019s record page 172, line 19 and page 192, line 3), although he subsequently embellished his statement; (4) Mr. Nathaniel admitted working for three specialised units that committed crimes; (5) the ID conclusion regarding Mr. Nathaniel\u2019s knowledge is reasonable; (6) a 17 years association does increase the chances Mr. Nathaniel had knowledge, and since he asserts having known nothing, the ID did not found passive acquiescence; and (7) Mr. Nathaniel remained with the NPF and his service cannot be equated to legitimate duties pursued in times of conflict or instability. [29] The Minister argues the decision is reasonable and must stand. V. Discussion [30] As the parties have confirmed to the Court, the applicable standard of review in this case is presumed to be that of reasonableness, and nothing rebuts that presumption (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at paras 16-17 [Vavilov]; Hadhiri v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1284). Hence, as the Federal Court of Appeal confirmed recently in Stojanoviv v Canada (Attorney General of Canada) 2020 FCA 6, para 34, the Court must see if the ID\u2019s determination is reasonable in terms of both the outcome and the process. This approach requires this Court to assess whether the ID\u2019s determination is justified, transparent and intelligible and whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes that are defensible on the facts and law: Vavilov at para 86; Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 at para 47, [2008] 1 SCR 190. This Court should not pre-empt the ID by making its own determination of the merits of the decision and then assess the ID\u2019s determination against its own view of the matter. [31] Before the ID, the burden lied with the Minister to demonstrate there existed reasonable grounds to believe (section 33 of the Act) that Mr. Nathaniel committed \u201can act outside Canada that constitutes an offence referred to sections 4 to 7 of the Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act\u201d (paragraph 35(1)(a) of the Act). Reasonable grounds to believe is less than the balance of probabilities, but more than mere suspicion (Ramirez v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration), 1992 FCA 8540; Ezokola at paras 29, 101. \u201cReasonable grounds will exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information\u201d (Mugesera v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 40 at para 114). [32] I am satisfied that the record supports the ID\u2019s conclusions, and that the process leading to the decision is reasonable. Mr. Nathaniel has not convinced me that the decision is unreasonable. [33] First, in light of contradictions between Mr. Nathaniel\u2019s statements to the CBSA officer and his testimony before the ID, it was open to the ID to impeach Mr. Nathaniel\u2019s credibility and give more weight to the first statements, which were those made to the CBSA officer (Athie v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FC 425 at para 49). The role of the Court is not to reweigh the evidence (Vavilov at para 125). This credibility finding led the ID to find that Mr. Nathaniel was promoted based on merit, rather than not promoted because he was a good cop, and to find that it was inconceivable he had no knowledge of the atrocities being committed. These conclusions are reasonable given the facts, and are supported by the Court\u2019s case law (Torres Rubianes v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration ) 2006 FC 1140; Hadhiri c Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2016 FC 1284). [34] There is substantial documentary evidence suggesting that the three special units committed crimes against humanity at the time Mr. Nathaniel served, and complicity can be found notwithstanding the fact that the individual is not present at the location at the time of a specific crime. In addition, the evidence adduced before the ID demonstrates Mr. Nathaniel personally participated in the operations and committed such crimes. Finally Mr. Nathaniel\u2019s argument regarding passive acquiescence must fail, as argued by the Minister, since Mr. Nathaniel denies knowledge. [35] More particularly, the ID weighted the documentary evidence and reasonably found that the NPF, and more particularly the three special units, committed crimes against humanity; the conclusion is amply supported by the credible documentary evidence adduced before the ID. The fact that there are one or two mentions in the whole document indicating some cops in the NPF are good does not render the decision unreasonable. Again, the role of the Court is not to reweigh the evidence. Although a selective reading of the documentary evidence may be ground to quash a decision, the administrative decision maker is entitled to prefer one evidence over the other after considering them (Liang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 765 at para 67; Camacho Garcia v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 611 at paras 14-18; Huang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 288 at para 26) or by taking into account the individual\u2019s specific circumstances (Gonzalez Martinez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 5; Wilson v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 711). Finally, the ID did not find the NPF to have a limited and brutal purpose and in fact specifically indicated that the SARS was not shown to be such an organisation. [36] I find no error in the ID\u2019s analysis of the Ezokola factors, given my conclusions on the aforementioned arguments raised by Mr. Nathaniel.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR: TC105038 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW This decision addresses whether the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) erred in finding that Alexis David Ramos Sanchez(the Appellant) faces a generalized risk upon return to El Salvador and that he is not entitled to protection under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). There is a long line of Federal Court case law interpreting the concept of generalized risk. Historically, two lines of case law emerged with regard to whether individuals targeted by gangs for extortion or recruitment qualify for protection under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the IRPA. The central tension along which these cases diverge is whether personal targeting distinguishes an individual risk from a generalized risk, entitling a Claimant to protection. However, a preponderance of authority from the Federal Court has since emerged. There is now consensus at the Federal Court as to the proper approach in the assessment of risk under paragraph 97(1)(b). In these Reasons, I set out a framework of analysis for assessing paragraph 97(1)(b) claims. I have applied this framework in my consideration of this appeal. Counsel argues that the RPD\u2019s generalized risk finding is in error. I agree. The RPD found that the Appellant was targeted for his ability to pay extortion. The RPD found that extortion is widespread in El Salvador and the consequential risk to the Appellant\u2019s life is generalized under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii). This is incorrect. The RPD applied Federal Court case law from one of the two historically divergent lines of jurisprudence, rather than recent case law which has reconciled these approaches and established the proper framework of assessment. I am reviewing the RPD decision on the standard of correctness as I do not find the RPD enjoyed a meaningful advantage. There is no new evidence on appeal, and I have no jurisdiction to hold a hearing. Having independently assessed all the evidence, I find that the Appellant more likely than not personally faces a risk to his life that is not faced generally in El Salvador. I further agree with the RPD that the Appellant is credible and that he does not have access to state protection. I also find that he does not have a viable Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) in El Salvador, and that he is a person in need of protection. DECISION The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a person in need of protection. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL ISSUES The Appellant is a citizen of El Salvador who worked as a civil engineer for a San Salvador infrastructure company. In his Basis of Claim (BOC) form, he alleges that the Mara Salvatrucha (the Maras or MS-13) personally threatened him with death. On December 15, 2018, armed MS-13 members approached him at work and demanded collaboration payments. They warned him not to approach the police. He reported the extortion demand to his employer, who paid the funds. However, on December 28, 2018, MS-13 approached him again. They demanded that he provide an additional collaboration payment. They did not accept his explanation that his employer had already provided the funds. They warned that if he refused to pay, they would kill him and his wife. His employer refused to provide the additional funds and he made the payment out of fear. The Appellant filed a report with the police, but they failed to investigate or provide him with any protection. After reporting the Maras to the authorities, he received a threatening telephone call from a Mexican telephone number. The caller was aware of private details from his life and demanded that he make collaboration payments every month or they would kill his wife. That same night, he heard gunshots outside of his home. The Appellant struggled to make the monthly payments. He contacted the police for protection, but he was told that they have insufficient staff to process his case. In February 2019, he told members of MS-13 that he could no longer afford the payments. They told him he needed to find the money, or they would kill him and his family. He struggled to maintain the payments. In April 2019, he approached the authorities again. This time, the police issued a report, but they did not provide him with protection. Instead, they warned him about MS-13 retaliation. In fear for his life, the Appellant fled to Canada, leaving his wife and children in a gated community where they remain in hiding. He did not have enough money to pay for his family to flee together and he believes that they are safer in El Salvador without him in the country. The Minister intervened at the RPD but not at the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) The Minister intervened in the claim through documents alone at the RPD. The Minister raised the following credibility and program integrity concerns in the Appellant\u2019s case: (1) His immigration forms do not mention that he was denied a United States (US) visa in 2008, that he was denied Express Entry to Canada in 2016, and his address history is inconsistent with his US visa application; (2) He failed to use his US visa to flee El Salvador and he delayed leaving El Salvador for 10 weeks after he obtained a Canadian visa; and (3) He applied to visit Canada to run in a marathon, and this is different from his reason for claiming refugee protection. The Minister has not intervened in the Appellant\u2019s appeal before the RAD. Further to the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Alazar, I have considered whether \u201cthe case has materially shifted away from the RPD\u2019s decision and the appeal as it was framed by the [person subject to the appeal]\u201d such that procedural fairness requires me to notify the Minister before rendering my decision. In my view, there is no new issue that is legally and factually distinct from the grounds of appeal, and which cannot reasonably be said to arise from the RPD decision or the issues on appeal as framed by the Appellant. However, out of an abundance of caution, I notified the Minister that I would be considering whether a safe and reasonable IFA is available in the Appellant\u2019s particular circumstance. This notice was provided to the Minister on July 16, 2021, with a deadline to respond of July 30, 2021. The Minister has not responded to my notice. As such, I have determined the appeal based on the evidence that I have before me on Record. The RPD decision The RPD accepted that the Appellant is credible, and that no protection was forthcoming from the Salvadoran state. The RPD also accepted that the Maras operate as a de facto authority, and they are known to make efforts to track down people in the country. The RPD denied the Appellant\u2019s claim on the basis that he faces a generalized risk upon return to El Salvador. In support of this determination, the RPD made the following findings: The predominant line of Federal Court cases has held that Claimants who fear extortion, violence, threats, and reprisals from criminal gangs for failing to comply with their demands are victims of generalized violence and criminality. The Appellant is perceived as having the ability to pay extortion demands. His profile is no higher than other persons working in El Salvador. The fact that he was personally targeted does not necessarily remove him from the generalized risk category. He suffered no consequences from his reports with the authorities. He has not alleged that MS-13 has threatened his family members in El Salvador. The objective evidence establishes that extortion is a widespread risk for everyone in El Salvador. In the Appellant\u2019s particular circumstances, the consequential harm that he faces is caught by the generalized risk exception at 97(1)(b)(ii). ANALYSIS OF CLAIMS UNDER Paragraph 97(1)(b) OF THE IRPA The rise of complementary protection The international refugee protection regime established by the United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees offers protection to individuals who fear persecution based on one of five enumerated grounds. As refugee law Professor James Hathaway argues, persons whose risk is not connected to their civil or political status are effectively \u201cexcluded from the rights regime established by the Convention.\u201d In response to concerns about the limitations of the Convention refugee definition, the Executive Committee of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) issued a Conclusion on the Provision of International Protection including through Complementary Forms of Protection. This statement acknowledges that many people who are not eligible for refugee protection under the Convention may still require international protection. The UNHCR Conclusion also affirms that measures to provide complementary protection should strengthen, rather than undermine, the existing international refugee protection regime. In June 2002, the IRPA came into force. Subsection 97(1) incorporated Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). This provision recognized the expanded scope of protection under these international human rights instruments. The IRPA also granted the Immigration and Refugee Board jurisdiction to assess the consolidated grounds of protection. Subsection 97(1) of the IRPA states: Person in need of protection 97 (1) A person in need of protection is a person in Canada whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally (a) to a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; or (b) to a risk to their life or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment if (i) the person is unable or, because of that risk, unwilling to avail themself of the protection of that country, (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in every part of that country and is not faced generally by other individuals in or from that country, (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and (iv) the risk is not caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care. To be a person in need of protection, the Federal Court of Appeal held in Proph\u00e8te that a Claimant must show, on a balance of probabilities, that they face personally, in every part of their country, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment that is not faced generally by other individuals in or from their home country. Justice Trudel also held that this provision \u201cnecessitates an individualized inquiry, which is to be conducted on the basis of the evidence adduced by a claimant \u2018in the context of a present or prospective risk\u2019...\u201d However, the Court declined to answer the certified question\u2014whether the generalized risk exception at 97(1)(b)(ii) applies to a subgroup of individuals who face a significantly heightened risk. The Court held that the question was too broad and answering it in a factual vacuum would be inappropriate. This provision is meant to protect individuals whose claims do not have a nexus to a Convention ground. If a risk has a nexus, it should be assessed under section 96 of the IRPA. While generalized risk defeats a 97(1)(b) claim, it should not be imported into the analysis of section 96 claims or limit the scope of Convention refugee protection. Subsection 97(1) has been the subject of much judicial and academic commentary, with some arguing that the provision is under inclusive of Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations. Decision makers are bound by the text of paragraph 97(1)(b), and it must be understood within the interpretative provisions of the IRPA, which emphasize Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations. This includes the importance of offering protection and safe haven to those at risk. The provision should not be \u201cunduly narrow[ed] or widen[ed].\u201d As Justice Russell explained in Correa: [50] \u2026 I think it necessary to avoid both extremes in interpreting the provision. At one end of the spectrum this would mean emptying s. 97(1)(b) of any protection for victims of criminal gangs. At the other end would be an interpretation that is so broad that essentially all those with a real and personal risk related to these gangs qualify for protection. The latter may be more in line with Canada\u2019s international human rights obligations, but, in my view, it cannot be reconciled with the language of (b). [emphasis added] The emergence and reconciliation of two lines of Federal Court caselaw After the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s 2009 decision in Proph\u00e8te, the jurisprudence developed along two lines. The first set of cases include decisions overturning generalized risk findings where there is a clear pattern of personal targeting. The second set of cases include decisions upholding generalized risk findings where the threats and harm were insufficient to place the Claimant at any greater risk than others in or from their country. In the appeal before me, the RPD relied almost entirely on cases in the second set. The central tension along which these cases diverge is whether personal targeting distinguishes an individual risk from a generalized risk. The approach set out in the second set of cases is best illustrated by the Federal Court\u2019s 2011 decision in Paz Guifarro. In this decision, Chief Justice Crampton held that death threats and retaliatory physical attacks following a failure to pay extortion failed to create a personal risk not faced generally. In Chief Justice Crampton\u2019s view, \u201c[t]his is so even where that sub-group may be specifically targeted. It is particularly so when the risk arises from criminal conduct or activity.\u201d Chief Justice Crampton also stated: [33] Given the frequency with which claims such as those that were advanced in the case at bar continue to be made under s. 97, I find it necessary to underscore that is now settled law that claims based on past and likely future targeting of the claimant will not meet the requirements of paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii) of the IRPA where (i) such targeting in the claimant\u2019s home country occurred or is likely to occur because of the claimant\u2019s membership in a sub-group of persons returning from abroad or perceived to have wealth for other reasons, and (ii) that sub-group is sufficiently large that the risk can reasonably be characterized as being widespread or prevalent in that country. In my view, a subgroup of such persons numbering in the thousands would be sufficiently large as to render the risk they face widespread or prevalent in their home country, and therefore \u201cgeneral\u201d within the meaning of paragraph 97(1)(b)(ii), even though that subgroup may only constitute a small percentage of the general population in that country. Following this decision, other justices of the Federal Court took a somewhat different approach. Most notably, Justice Gleason set out a two-step framework in Portillo for the assessment of claims under paragraph 97(1)(b). This framework is as follows: [40] In my view, the essential starting point for the required analysis under of is to first appropriately determine the nature of the risk faced by the claimant. This requires an assessment of whether the claimant faces an ongoing or future risk (i.e. whether he or she continues to face a \u201cpersonalized risk\u201d), what the risk is, whether such risk is one of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and the basis for the risk. [\u2026] [41] The next required step in the analysis under of , after the risk has been appropriately characterized, is the comparison of the correctly-described risk faced by the claimant to that faced by a significant group in the country to determine whether the risks are of the same nature and degree. If the risk is not the same, then the claimant will be entitled to protection under of . [\u2026] Since it was decided in 2012, the Portillo analysis has been followed by the preponderance of Federal Court cases to consider 97(1)(b)(ii). As Justice de Montigny held in Herrera Chinchilla, \u201ca consensus has emerged as to the proper approach to be followed when faced with an allegation of risk\u201d which has been well captured by Portillo. In a recent RAD decision, one of my colleagues made a similar finding about the emergence of a consensus. I agree. The Portillo line of caselaw has reconciled and superseded the historically divergent approaches. The framework of analysis for claims under paragraph 97(1)(b) Building on the cases of Portillo and Correa, I propose the following framework of analysis for assessing claims under paragraph 97(1)(b) of the IRPA: First Stage: Determine the risk faced by the Claimant Clearly identify the nature of any ongoing or future risk. Clearly identify the basis (or initial reason) for the risk. Clearly identify the degree of the risk (or proximity to the risk). Consider any relevant factor, such as: The severity and number of incidents; and Any pattern or link between the incidents; and Any change over time. Second Stage: Determine whether the risk is faced generally by others Compare the nature and degree of the risk faced by the Claimant with the nature and degree of the risk faced generally by other individuals in or from their country. In my Reasons below, I describe the steps in this framework of analysis. First Stage: Determine the risk faced by the Claimant The nature of any ongoing or future risk: An ongoing or future risk is a real risk that a Claimant continues to face. For example, a Claimant may face a risk of death, sexual violence, or other serious harm. As Justice Russell explains in Correa, to find that a Claimant is personally subject to a risk under the first step of the test \u201cmeans simply that they are at risk\u201d and that the \u201calleged risk is real.\u201d The use of the term \u2018personal risk\u2019 at this stage of the analysis is not meant to indicate that the risk is not faced generally. Rather, the term is used to underscore that the risk is real. In Guerrero, Justice Zinn cautions against the imprecise use of the term \u2018personal risk\u2019: [\u2026 M]any decisions state or imply that a generalized risk is not a personal risk. What is usually meant is that the claimant\u2019s risk is one faced generally by others and thus the claimant does not meet the requirements of the Act. It is not meant that the claimant has no personal risk. For example, indiscriminate violence may subject a Claimant personally to a risk, but it is also one that is faced generally by others in or from their home country. Rarely will a claim based on gang violence turn on whether the risk is an ongoing or future risk. Most claims will turn on whether that risk, in addition to being personal, is also not faced generally by others in or from the home country. This is necessarily fact specific. Establishing that there is a personal risk is important because \u201cif there is no personal risk to the claimant, then there is no need to do any further analysis of the claim [under paragraph 97(1)(b)]; there is simply no risk.\u201d If it is determined that there is an ongoing or future risk, the decision-maker should clearly identify the nature of that risk. The nature of the risk can be set out in a short sentence. The nature of the risk may also change with time. For example, a Claimant may be targeted for extortion and initially only face a risk of extortion. However, through threats and retaliatory attacks, the nature of the risk may change and become a risk of serious harm or death. The Claimant bears the burden of establishing any transformation in the risk over time. Claimants must also establish that the risk that they face is a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Where the risk is not a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, there is no need for further analysis of the claim under paragraph 97(1)(b); the risk does not qualify the Claimant for protection under this provision. A risk to life arises where there is a real risk that a Claimant will be arbitrarily deprived of their inherent right to life. Cruel and unusual treatment is conduct towards another person which is \u201cgrossly disproportionate\u201d and \u201coutrage[s] standards of decency.\u201d This concept is to be \u201cinterpreted in a flexible and dynamic manner to accord with evolving standards of decency.\u201d Abuse from state and non-state actors may meet this threshold. Some treatment will always be grossly disproportionate and will always outrage standards of decency\u201d such as \u201cthe lash, irrespective of the number of lashes imposed.\u201d Sexual violence is also a form of cruel and unusual treatment. The basis for the risk: The basis for the risk is the initial reason that the Claimant was targeted. For example, a Claimant may have initially been targeted because they failed to comply with extortion, recruitment, or other demands for cooperation. However, the initial basis for the risk should not be confused with the ongoing or future risk itself. The reason that clearly setting out the basis for the risk is important is that it helps decision makers avoid conflating the basis for the risk with the actual risk in circumstances where the nature of the risk has changed. The basis for the risk can be set out in a short sentence. The degree of risk: The degree of risk is the Claimant\u2019s proximity to the ongoing or future risk. This assessment is fact specific. Relevant factors include the severity and number of incidents, the existence of a pattern or link between incidents, and whether there has been an escalation over time. This will help determine whether a personal risk has transformed into one that is not faced generally by others in or from the Claimant\u2019s country. In addition, there is no requirement for violence to have occurred for a risk to become proximate. Credible threats of violence that result in a risk to life may create a personal risk not faced generally under paragraph 97(1)(b). Reprisal attacks also should not be dismissed as \u201cconsequential harm\u201d stemming from the initial risk of extortion or forced recruitment. As Justice Russell explains in Correa, \u201c[t]here is no \u201cconsequential\u201d or \u201cresulting\u201d risk under s. 97, there is only risk, objectively and prospectively considered.\u201d The Federal Court has also cautioned against simply comparing the nature of risk faced by a Claimant to the facts in Correa and dismissing the risk in the case before them as lesser. However, personal targeting will not always entitle a Claimant to protection under paragraph 97(1)(b). As Justice Russell explains in Correa, this is because \u201c[p]ersonal targeting is an imprecise term\u201d which includes a broad range of situations: [\u2026] from isolated or repeated (but not necessarily linked) encounters with criminal gangs, to claimants caught in the type of downward spiral of demands, threats, and escalating violence, where gang members for whatever reason have focused their attention on a specific individual and will not relent until their demands are met (often repeatedly) or the target (and often their family members) are dead or flee the country. This captures the difficulty of determining claims under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii). In claims involving extortion there is almost always an implicit or explicit threat of serious harm. However, the possibility of a greater degree of risk in the future without more may be insufficient to establish a claim. Decision makers must determine where along a broad spectrum a Claimant\u2019s risk falls. This amounts to a line-drawing exercise which must be responsive to the particular facts of a claim. For this reason, it is \u201cimpossible to anticipate all of the factual circumstances that may arise, or to comprehensively define in advance on which side of the line they will fall.\u201d Second Stage: Determine whether the risk is faced generally by others Comparing the nature and degree of the risk: The comparison of the nature and degree of the risk faced by the Claimant with the nature and degree of the risk faced generally by other individuals in or from their country is fact specific. This is a forward-looking inquiry that requires careful consideration of the objective evidence about the risk faced generally in a Claimant\u2019s country. Decision makers should not proceed in a rigid or quantitative manner by identifying what \u2018sub-group\u2019 a Claimant belongs to and then assess the risk faced by that sub-group. Instead, decision makers should undertake an individualized assessment by evaluating whether the nature and degree of risk faced by the Claimant is of the same nature and degree of risk faced generally in their country. The question is not whether others could eventually find themselves in the Claimant\u2019s position, but rather whether others generally are in that position now. The Court has warned against dismissing personalized targeting as a risk that is shared by large segments of the population without examining proximity to the risk. As Justice Rennie observed in Vaquerano Lovato, \u201c[i]f any risk created by \u2018criminal activity\u2019 is always considered a general risk, it is hard to fathom a scenario in which the requirements of would ever be met.\u201d For this reason, it is an error to dismiss direct, repeated, and escalating threats as the result of mere criminality faced generally by others in or from the home country. For 97(1)(b) to be given any meaning, proximity to the risk must be at the center of the analysis comparing the risk faced by an individual Claimant with the risk faced broadly in their country. To do otherwise unduly narrows the provision and renders it incapable of offering complementary protection. Decision makers must not strip paragraph 97(1)(b) of any content or meaning. In making a finding under the generalized risk exception, it is important to remember that a risk of being threatened with death one day in the future, without more, is a risk that may be widely shared and therefore generalized. In Correa, Justice Russell explains that \u201c[t]here are a great many instances in which such a risk will be experienced \u2018personally\u2019 (i.e. the risk is real), but still be a risk faced generally by other individuals in or from an applicant\u2019s country.\u201d For example: Poor young males in several South American countries will be subject to a \u201cpersonal\u201d risk of forced recruitment to criminal gangs, even if they have had no previous encounters with these gangs, but this is risk experienced generally by a sufficient segment of those countries\u2019 populations that falls within the (b)(ii) exception. The same is true of shop owners in several countries, who are perceived to have an ability to pay extortion demands. In contrast, and depending on the facts of the case, a risk of death that has been established through repeated, linked, and escalating personal targeting will remove a Claimant from the generalized risk exception. When a Claimant is personally targeted in a way that others generally are not, this distinguishes their individualized risk from a generalized risk, resulting in protection under (b)(ii), where all other criteria are met. The Claimant bears the burden of establishing that it is more likely than not that they are subjected personally to a risk that is not faced generally by others in or from their home country. Justice Shore provides a helpful example illustrating the difference between a proximate risk to life and a risk to life faced generally: \u201cThe risks of those standing in the same vicinity as the gunman cannot be considered the same as the risks of those standing directly in front of him.\u201d Summary An assessment in line with the framework set out above is broadly applicable in a variety of 97(1)(b) claims, and as below, must be applied by considering a Claimant\u2019s particular circumstances. I have applied this framework in my assessment of the Appellant\u2019s risk at paragraphs 51-55 of my Reasons, below. In my view, this approach does not collapse the two-step conjunctive test under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii). Claimants must still establish that they would be personally subjected to a risk and that this risk is not faced generally by others in or from their country. Depending on the facts of the case, direct threats of harm may not always entitle a Claimant to protection under paragraph 97(1)(b). Examples of these kinds of risks include isolated threats or warnings, or where threatening incidents are not sufficiently connected in the evidence. For example, in a recent RAD decision, one of my colleagues found that the test is not met where there is insufficient evidence to establish a link between disparate criminal incidents, or where the risk is speculative. I agree. By focusing on the nature and degree of the risk, decision makers can avoid the extremes warned against by the Federal Court of Appeal in Proph\u00e8te. ANALYSIS OF THE MERITS OF THE APPELLANT\u2019S CLAIM UNDER 97(1)(b) The Appellant has credibly established his allegations, on a balance of probabilities The RPD found that the Appellant is credible and that he established his allegations, on a balance of probabilities. It determined that he provided reasonable explanations for the concerns raised by the Ministerial intervention. I agree. These RPD findings are correct. Having independently assessed the complete Record, I find that the Appellant\u2019s evidence is credible. I have carefully considered the concerns identified in the Ministerial intervention before the RPD. In my view, these issues are minor, they are based on a misapprehension of the evidence, or they have been reasonably explained. First, the Appellant\u2019s failure to include visa denials from 2008 and 2016 on his immigration forms is minor. These denials are from years before the threat to his life. His failure to include them does not undermine the core of his claim. In addition, the Minister\u2019s argument that there is an address discrepancy is based on a misapprehension of the evidence. The address in the Appellant\u2019s US visa application is consistent with the address history on his Canadian immigration forms. Second, the Appellant explained that his fear crystalized in June 2019, after the authorities warned him about MS-13 retaliation. He fled El Salvador in a matter of weeks thereafter. This is a reasonable explanation for why he did not leave earlier on his US or Canadian visas. Third, it is an error to draw an adverse inference from a Claimant\u2019s failure to disclose to visa authorities the reason they are fleeing. In my view, the Appellant\u2019s application to visit Canada to run a marathon does not conflict with his allegation that his life is at risk in El Salvador. Having assessed the entire Record, I find that the Appellant\u2019s testimony is credible. He provided spontaneous detail about the extortion payments and death threats. He also filed credible supporting evidence, including: His criminal complaints, which corroborate his allegations; Medical evidence corroborating the severe stress caused by the death threats; and Letters of support from his colleague, sister, and mother which corroborate his allegations. The RPD did not identify any concerns with this evidence, and I have no reason to find otherwise on appeal. I find that the Appellant has credibly established his allegations, on a balance of probabilities. The Appellant faces a personal risk to life not faced generally under paragraph 97(1)(b) The RPD found that the Appellant was targeted for his ability to pay extortion. Since extortion is widespread in El Salvador, the RPD went on to find that the consequential risk to his life is generalized. This approach is incorrect. The RPD did not set out in precise language the initial reason for the risk\u2014extortion\u2014as distinct from the nature of the ongoing and future risk\u2014risk to life. The RPD erred when it dismissed the escalating threats as merely \u2018consequential harm\u2019 flowing from the extortion. The RPD also focused on the extortion underlying the risk, rather than the death threats and risk to life. This conflates the reason for the risk with the risk itself. I also agree with Counsel that the RPD erred when it focused on the Appellant\u2019s \u201cmembership in a sub-group of persons perceived to have wealth.\u201d This emphasizes the Maras initial motivation and reason for the risk, rather than the Appellant\u2019s ongoing and highly proximate risk to life. The correct approach is to assess the risk faced by the Claimant and determine whether it is one faced generally\u2014and with the same degree\u2014as others in El Salvador. First Stage: The Appellant is subjected personally to a risk to his life The Appellant was directly threatened with death. I find that the risk to his life is personal. The basis for the risk\u2014demands for money and reprisals for his failure to cooperate\u2014is distinct from the nature of the risk itself\u2014risk to life. The risk also increased in degree over time. It progressed from demands for payment to threats against the Appellant\u2019s life and the firing of warning shots at his home. While he was not assaulted, and his agents of harm had not yet carried out their threats of violence against him, there is no requirement for violence to establish a personal risk. In my view, there is a pattern of events over time that are explicitly connected by virtue of the agent of harm\u2019s repeated threats, demands and targeting. The Appellant was personally and specifically targeted for death. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that he is personally subjected to an ongoing risk to his life. Second Stage: The Appellant\u2019s personal risk to life is not faced generally by others Criminal targeting is widespread in El Salvador. As the RPD correctly found, El Salvador has become the most violent country in the world that is not in active warfare. It is the country with the \u201chighest homicide rate in the world.\u201d The cause of this violence is complex. The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre identifies the following factors: The causes of today\u2019s crime and violence [in El Salvador] are the same as those that drove the civil war - poverty, economic inequality, lack of opportunities, social exclusion and unequal access to services. These seeds of violence, inequality and discrimination were sown during colonial times, and blossomed as a result of military dictatorships and war. This overall context, and the prevalence of violent crime in El Salvador, is directly relevant to an assessment of risk under subparagraph 97(1)(b)(ii). However, it is not determinative of whether a risk is faced generally. When comparing the risk faced by the Appellant with the risk faced generally by others in El Salvador, the nature and degree of the risk must be at the centre of the analysis. The fact that violent crime, including homicide, occurs at a high rate in El Salvador does not mean that the Appellant\u2019s personal risk to life is of the same intensity or proximity. I find that others are not generally in the same position as the Appellant. While extortion is a widespread risk in El Salvador, the general population does not currently face a risk to their life for failing to comply with the escalating demands of a criminal organization. The Appellant was personally targeted and threatened with death in a series of connected and escalating incidents. His risk is highly proximate. He faces a risk that he will be killed. Even if others could eventually find themselves in the Appellant\u2019s position in the future, this does not mean that they are generally in his position now. Counsel argues that \u201cthe general population in El Salvador is not in a position in which they have been unable to meet a gang\u2019s extortion demands, and are therefore liable to being killed by the gang for failure to comply with their demands.\u201d I agree. The Appellant\u2019s risk to life is distinguishable in nature and degree from the risk of criminality faced generally in El Salvador. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant faces a personal risk to his life, and that this risk is not faced generally by others in El Salvador. The Appellant does not have access to state protection or a viable IFA in El Salvador The RPD determined that \u201cno protection was forthcoming\u201d for the Appellant in El Salvador. The RPD also accepted that the Maras control 94 percent of El Salvador\u2019s municipalities, they operate as a de facto authority, and they have been known to make efforts to track down people in the country. I agree with these RPD findings. Having independently assessed the Record, I find that the Appellant does not have access to adequate state protection or a viable IFA in El Salvador, satisfying subparagraphs 97(1)(b)(i) and (ii) of the IRPA. The Appellant does not have access to operationally adequate state protection The Appellant sought assistance from the state on multiple occasions and he followed up about the status of his reports. However, the authorities failed to investigate or provide him with any protection. Where the \u201cdocumentary evidence situates the individual Claimant\u2019s experience as part of a broader pattern of state inability or refusal to extend protection, then the absence of state protection is made out.\u201d I find the documentary evidence supports such a pattern in the Appellant\u2019s circumstances. Weaknesses and corruption in the security forces and judiciary contribute to a \u201chigh level of impunity for crimes in El Salvador.\u201d Reports to the authorities are \u201coften relayed back to the gangs, which then exact severe retribution on the complainants.\u201d As a result, the state is \u201cunlikely to be able to provide effective protection.\u201d I find that the Appellant does not have access to operationally adequate state protection. The Appellant does not have access to a viable IFA In my view, the agents of harm possess both the means and motivation to locate the Appellant throughout El Salvador, such that he faces a risk to his life throughout the country. Motivation: The Maras have threatened the Appellant with death at his place of business, and they have monitored him at home where they have fired warning shots. They have also demonstrated that they have extensive information about him and his life. While the Appellant\u2019s family members in El Salvador have not been threatened by MS-13 since he fled, he has credibly established that they remain in hiding. He provided detailed testimony about their residence in a gated community where his spouse works from home and his children never leave the house. Where a family member has been able to live safely while in hiding in another location, this does not make that location a viable IFA. In my view, the agents of harm have demonstrated a continuing interest in the Appellant. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Maras possess the motivation to locate the Appellant, such that he faces a risk to his life throughout El Salvador. Means: The Maras are active throughout the vast majority of the country. The objective evidence indicates that \u201c[g]iven the small size of the country and gangs\u2019 extensive surveillance networks, people can often be located within 24 hours.\u201d When someone new arrives in an area, they will be \u201cchecked out, asked where they used to live and asked for their ID card, which bears their address.\u201d The Maras have infiltrated state agencies and they use their connections with corrupt state authorities to obtain information on those they pursue. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the Maras possess the means to locate the Appellant, such that he faces a risk to his life throughout El Salvador. I find that there is no viable IFA in El Salvador in the Appellant\u2019s particular circumstances. The Appellant\u2019s risk satisfies subparagraphs 97(1)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the IRPA The Appellant\u2019s risk to life is not connected to lawful sanctions or caused by the state\u2019s inability to provide medical care. This satisfies subparagraphs 97(1)(b)(iii) and (iv) of the IRPA. CONCLUSION The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a person in need of protection.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Alexis David Ramos Sanchez(the', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 40, 'end': 44}, {'text': 'December 15', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 519, 'end': 521}, {'text': 'December 28', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 562, 'end': 564}, {'text': 'February', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 741, 'end': 742}, {'text': 'April', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 785, 'end': 786}, {'text': '10', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 990, 'end': 991}, {'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 7572, 'end': 7573}, {'text': 'Alexis David Ramos Sanchez(the', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 40, 'end': 44}, {'text': 'December 15', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 519, 'end': 521}, {'text': 'December 28', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 562, 'end': 564}, {'text': 'February', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 741, 'end': 742}, {'text': 'April', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 785, 'end': 786}, {'text': '10', 'label': 'ID', 'start': 990, 'end': 991}]", "label": "accepted"}
{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TC009944 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Vasil Magalashvili (the Appellant) is of Georgian nationality and filed an appeal against the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) dated July 17, 2020, rejecting his request for refugee protection. The Appellant is a member of the United National Movement (UNM) and fears the Georgian Dream party (GD), currently in power in Georgia. He alleges that he was attacked by members of GD on three occasions, in June 2016, July 2017 and August 2018. The determinative issue before the RPD was credibility. It remains the same before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). DECISION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. ROLE OF THE RAD The RAD reviews decisions of the RPD on a standard of correctness after conducting an independent assessment of the evidence before it. The exception to this rule is that the RAD may apply a deferential standard in some circumstances. I have conducted my own independent assessment of all of the evidence in this case, including the audio-recording of the hearing. Unless specifically stated and explained below, I have applied a correctness standard in this case. ANALYSIS November 2016 Attack The RPD was not satisfied with the Appellant\u2019s explanation regarding the inconsistencies between his testimony and his Basis of Claim (BOC) with respect to his identification of the assailants having perpetrated the attack. The RPD reached the conclusion that the Appellant had failed to establish that he was attacked by members of the GD party, as alleged. The RPD also noted that the Appellant was inconsistent regarding the follow-up of the police investigations in the November 2016 attack. He testified that he sent his cousin to enquire about the progress of the investigation, but in his BOC, he mentioned that his mother called the police to follow up. The Appellant submits that both of those inconsistencies are minor and do not affect the overall claim. He argues that the RPD erred when it entered into an overzealous and microscopic examination of the Appellant\u2019s credibility and that a refugee claim should not be determined on the basis of a memory test. I agree with the analysis of the RPD regarding the unexplained discrepancy between the Appellant\u2019s BOC and his testimony about having recognised all three assailants or not. In fact, his testimony regarding the events surrounding the November 2016 attack is unclear and seems to have evolved in an effort to address the concerns raised by the questions of the member. The Appellant\u2019s justification for the discrepancy was that he knew that all three of the attackers were affiliated with GD and that there was an error in the BOC. Though this incoherence is, in and of itself, minor, I note that the Appellant also testified that he reported to the police authorities who visited him at the hospital that he knew all three of the attackers to be of GD at the time of the event. Thus, this gap raises suspicions as to why he stated that he only recognised one of them in his BOC. Then, when asked about who followed up on the police investigations, the Appellant testified that he sent a cousin to the police station. Again, in his BOC, he reports having asked his mother to call the authorities to follow up on the matter. He explained that there was a mistake in the BOC, as his mother went to the police station to follow up on the matter after the second incident. Then, he changed his story line, and stated that both his cousin and his mother followed up on the investigation in the November 2016 attack. I believe that the evolutive nature of his testimony undermines his credibility as to whether this November 2016 attack even occurred. The uncertainty of the oral evidence is exacerbated by his explanation for not having produced any documentary evidence from the hospital or the police authorities to support his allegation. He first explained that he tried to contact the hospital, but that his number has been blocked by all public institutions because of the one of the agents of harm. When asked whether his Canadian phone number was also blocked, he changed his answer and mentioned that he asked relatives to call the hospital for him to obtain the documents. When requested to explain why earlier he stated that no one could help to get documents because they were afraid, he quickly replied that he asked the relatives to call the hospital, but not to go there. I do not find this justification even near convincing. I find this part of the testimony to be untrustworthy and to undermine the overall credibility of the Appellant regarding this event. In light of this analysis, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant failed to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that the November 2016 attack took place as alleged. June 2017 Attacks The RPD found that the Appellant\u2019s credibility was negatively affected by his omission to include in his BOC alleged death threats that he received during the previous attacks of November 2016 and 2017, while only mentioning those death threats with regard to the July 2018 attacks. The RPD also considered that the Appellant failed to provide a reasonable explanation for the inconsistency regarding the number of days he allegedly spent at the hospital after the June 2017 attack, having indicated in his BOC that he was hospitalised for 12 days, in contrast with his testimony stating that he left the facility the same day. Regarding being fired from his employment as a consequence of his political activism with the UNM, the RPD concluded that the Appellant failed to provide an explanation for the omission in his BOC to the effect that he was first threatened by the attackers regarding his job security. The tribunal also noted the inconsistencies between the Appellant\u2019s testimony and his BOC regarding the role of his supervisor in his dismissal and drew a negative inference with respect to his allegations that he received threats regarding his employment due to his political involvement. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in drawing a negative inference on the basis of his omission to specify the death threats issued to him during the attack. He argues that his explanation was reasonable and consistent with his description of his earlier beatings. Regarding the inconsistency between his BOC and testimony about the length of time he spent at the hospital after the January 2018 beatings, he submits that it was an error in the BOC, that his explanation that he was hospitalised after the January 2018 beatings was reasonable. He argues that this inconsistency is insufficient to reject all evidence as being not credible. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in drawing a negative inference as a result of this omission, as he was entitled to add details of his story during the hearing, that allows the claimant to flesh out their story. He adds that he provided elaborative details during the hearing regarding the loss of his job, that in no way changes the substance of his claim. He maintains that he remained consistent with the context of the event, merely that he had been beaten. Like the RPD, I find the inconsistency between the Appellant\u2019s BOC and his testimony regarding the time spent at the hospital after the June 2017 attack to be concerning. I note, in particular, that in his BOC, the Appellant detailed his alleged stay at the hospital at that time as having included a visit of the police officers to take his statement. Justifying his 12 day visit at the hospital, he described in his narrative that he was badly beaten and covered in bruises. Indeed, in light of the sufferings that are attached to this kind of situation, I would expect consistency between his BOC and testimony in this regard. I agree with the RPD that the explanation provided by the Appellant to justify this gap in the evidence is unsatisfying. I believe that it is through those lenses that one needs to analyse the inconsistency regarding the death threats allegedly uttered by the assailants during the attacks. I agree with the analysis of the RPD at paragraphs 16 and 17 of the decision. I note that during his testimony, the Appellant explained that he did not leave the country after the June 2017 attacks, because he felt that they would stop, that they would not beat him up so seriously as to knock him down unconscious. I find this statement to be inconsistent with a person who would have received death threats. I therefore conclude that the RPD was correct when it drew a negative inference on the Appellant\u2019s credibility following this unexplained omission of including the death threats in his narrative with respect to the November 2016 and June 2017 attacks. I believe the same analysis is applicable to the inconsistency regarding the threats to lose his employment because of his political activism, however, I find that it is not necessary for me to address the Appellant\u2019s submissions in that regard as, either way, it will not have an impact on the result of the overall analysis and outcome. Lack of documentation The RPD noted that the Appellant submitted no documentary evidence in support of his claim. The panel rejected the explanation given by the Appellant that he was made aware 6 weeks prior to his hearing that he had lost the documents in his house in Georgia. The RPD also took into account the Appellant\u2019s lack of effort in obtaining new documents to establish the central allegations of his claim, including, for instance, his political affiliation. As a result, it drew a negative inference from the lack of reliable and credible documentation in support of his allegations. The Appellant submits that, according to the applicable jurisprudence, corroborative evidence is not required in the context of an asylum case, because of the presumption that the allegations are true, unless there is reason to doubt of their truthfulness. He argues that he provided a reasonable explanation for not submitting documentary evidence and that he made reasonable efforts to do so. He contends that the RPD erred when drawing a negative inference because he failed to apply post-hearing documentation, since the COVID-19 pandemic affected his ability to obtain documentation. As noted above, the oral and written evidence presented by the Appellant contained unexplained discrepancies and omissions that undermined the Appellant\u2019s credibility with respect to his central allegations that he was beaten by members of the GD. In those circumstances, and as taught by the jurisprudence, the RPD correctly drew a negative inference on the Appellant\u2019s credibility for failing to provide any documents in support of his claim. Even if he offered to do so at the hearing, he did not provide any such documents following the several weeks prior to the signing of the RPD decision. He also failed to explain how the pandemic affected his ability to obtain such documents. As noted by the RPD, the Appellant is represented by counsel. In my view, and as I noted above regarding his explanations to justify his failure to provide medical reports, the Appellant failed to lay out convincing arguments that could provide a reasonable justification for his lack of documentary evidence. Indeed, his explanations for his failure to do so include his phone number being allegedly blocked by the public authorities or the reluctance of his friends and family in Georgia to help him because they were afraid to do so. Most importantly, the Appellant did not provide any document to prove that he was the member of the UNM party, an allegation that is central to his claim. Consequently, I agree with the analysis articulated by the RPD at paragraphs 28-30 of the decision and find that the lack of documentary evidence undermines the Appellant\u2019s credibility with respect to his central allegation of his claim. Forward-looking risk The RPD concluded that the Appellant had failed to establish that he would be targeted by the members of the GD if he were to return to Georgia today. The tribunal considered that the Appellant failed to adduce sufficient evidence that the agents of persecution would still be looking for him, or that they knew he was no longer in the country. He argues that, if he were to return to Georgia, he would continue supporting the UNM. He submits that his political opinion and particular profile, as well as his intention to continue supporting the UNM, raises more than a mere possibility of prospective harm if he were to return to his home country. I note that the Appellant never submitted any evidence to support his allegation that he was an active member of the UNM in the first place. Considering the conclusions of non-credibility formulated above, the Appellant failed to establish that he had been an active member of the UNM, and targeted as a result by members of the GD. The Appellant also failed to provide evidence that, if he were to return to Georgia to be politically active with the UNM party, there is a serious possibility that he will be targeted and beaten or killed by members of the GD party. Overall credibility Finally, the RPD found that the Appellant has not been a credible and trustworthy witness and provided no credible documents to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he was actively involved with the UNM political party, or that he was targeted by the GD as a result of his political affiliation. The Appellant submits that, when considered in its totality, the evidence, including his oral and written testimony, corroborated by the objective documents about the situation in Georgia, establishes the factual basis for his fear of persecution. Though some parts of the Appellant\u2019s testimony were coherent with the BOC, especially when it came to the Appellant\u2019s involvement regarding the United National Movement (UNM) and how the GD leader was responsible for numerous similar instances regarding attacks against members of political groups such as the UNM, it was not sufficient to establish the November 2016, June 2017, and January 2018 incidents, as alleged. I therefore conclude that the RPD correctly found that the Appellant failed to establish that he would face a possibility of persecution on a Convention ground, nor has he established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would be personally subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to life, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, if he were to return to Georgia. CONCLUSION I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200117 Docket: IMM-3646-19 Citation: 2020 FC 71 Toronto, Ontario, January 17, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice Diner BETWEEN: FIDAN HAJIYEVA Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] Ms. Hajiyeva applied for a study permit, which was refused by an officer [Officer] at the Canadian Embassy in Ankara, Turkey, for failure to satisfy the statutory requirements. I made my decision from the bench, explaining why the Officer\u2019s findings were both reasonable and fair, promising reasons to follow. These are my reasons. II. Background [2] Ms. Hajiyeva is a married, 29-year-old citizen of Azerbaijan, who has two young children. She studied law in Azerbaijan, and has been a homemaker since 2011, raising her children for most of this period. In 2018, Ms. Hajiyeva was accepted into Seneca College\u2019s Human Resources Management Program. She applied for a study permit, but her application was refused in December 2018. Ms. Hajiyeva reapplied to Seneca and was again accepted the following year. However, her second study permit was also refused in April 2019 [Decision], which is the Decision under review. [3] The Officer was not satisfied that Ms. Hajiyeva would leave Canada at the end of her stay, based on family ties, and economic motives to remain in Canada which could outweigh her ties to her home country. The Officer also noted that her reasons for undertaking the proposed employment (presumably referring to her husband\u2019s plans) were vague and poorly documented. As a result, the Officer refused the application under subsection 216(1) of the Immigration Refugee Protection Regulation, SOR/2002-227. The Officer concluded by stating that \u201cyou are welcome to reapply if you feel that you can respond to these concerns and can demonstrate that your situation meets the requirements.\u201d [4] Ms. Hajiyeva claims that the Decision was unfair, inadequate and erroneous. Matters of procedural unfairness continue to attract a correctness standard of review (Garces Caceres v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020 FC 4, at paras 23). Reviewing the factual assessment of a student permit attracts the deferential standard of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, at para 10 [Vavilov]; Aghaalikhani v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1080, at para 11, citing Kavugho-Mission c Canada (Citoyennet\u00e9 et Immigration), 2018 FC 597, at para 8). I will begin the analysis on this point. III. Analysis A. The Decision was reasonable [5] Ms. Hajiyeva argues that the Officer ignored evidence, and failed to provide adequate reasons relying on Omijie v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 878, at para 26 [Omijie]. I find, however, that this case differs from Omijie. First, while the Applicant\u2019s parents and brother would remain in Azerbaijan, her immediate family (husband and children) would join her in Canada; she indicated her husband would obtain a work permit and gain international work experience, and her children would attend school and be exposed to Canadian values. The Officer\u2019s finding regarding her incentives to remain in Canada were reasonable. Here, the finding that her evidence and supporting documentation fell short of demonstrating that she would leave Canada at the end of her study period was open to the Officer. [6] Regarding the argument that the reasons were inadequate, one can understand in the context of visa office decisions, where multiple decisions must be made daily, that reasons will ordinarily be brief (see for instance Peiro v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1146, at para 15). Vavilov explains that reasons must be read in light of the context in which they were rendered (at para 94). I find that the reasons regarding the study permit were both sufficient and justified, and thus reasonable. B. No breach of procedural fairness occurred [7] Ms. Hajiyeva claims that the Officer relied on extrinsic evidence. There is no basis for this claim as the Officer based the Decision on the application materials submitted. [8] Ms. Hajiyeva also argues that she should have been given an opportunity to respond to evidence, as these were veiled credibility findings. The findings arose from the evidence placed before the Officer. Where an officer\u2019s concern \u201carises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns\u201d (Hassani v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 1283, at para 24). Such duty arises only where credibility is impugned, which did not occur here, despite Ms. Hajiyeva\u2019s claims. [9] Ultimately, a student permit seeker must satisfy all requirements; the officer is not required to inform the applicant of concerns regarding the sufficiency of the materials in support of the application (Al Aridi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 381, at para 20). Ms. Hajiyeva did not satisfy all requirements, and thus, the Officer was under no duty to inform her of the weaknesses in her application. [10] Finally, the correct Respondent to this application is the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (Federal Courts Citizenship, Immigration and Refugee Protection Rules, SOR/93\u201122, subsection 5(2), and Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, subsection 4(1)). The style of cause will be amended accordingly. IV. Conclusion [11] Ms. Hajiyeva has failed to demonstrate that the Decision was unreasonable, or that she suffered a breach of procedural fairness. Her application will accordingly be dismissed. [12] By way of a postscript, as the Officer aptly stated, Ms. Hajiyeva is free to reapply. Counsel for the Minister reiterated this at the hearing. I note that Ms. Hajiyeva is highly educated and both writes and speaks impressively, based on both her written pleadings to the Court, and her oral arguments (she represented herself, participating by phone from Azerbaijan). She may certainly wish to reapply, addressing the weakness in her application. JUDGMENT in IMM-3646-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: 1. This application for judicial review is dismissed. 2. No questions for certification were argued, and I agree none arise. 3. There is no award as to costs. 4. The style of cause is amended to reflect the Respondent as the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. \u201cAlan S.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200110 Docket: IMM-59-19 Citation: 2020 FC 29 Ottawa, Ontario, January 10, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice James W. O'Reilly BETWEEN: THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Applicant and ALDO GUSTAVO BARRIOS Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] Mr Aldo Gustavo Barrios is a citizen of Honduras who obtained refugee status and permanent residence in Canada. Subsequently, he acquired a Honduran passport and travelled to Honduras several times. On one of his returns to Canada, he told an officer of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) that he was no longer fearful of persecution in Honduras. [2] Another CBSA officer asked Mr Barrios to attend an interview. Mr Barrios complied and described to the officer his various trips to Honduras. [3] The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration then sought cessation of Mr Barrios\u2019s refugee status. Mr Barrios provided a written response. [4] A panel of the Immigration and Refugee Board considered and dismissed the Minister\u2019s request. The Board found that Mr Barrios had been denied the right to be represented by counsel during his initial encounter with the CBSA officer and during his interview. The Board found that both interactions were evidence-gathering hearings and that Mr Barrios should have been given notice of his right to counsel. The Board excluded evidence obtained during the encounters with the CBSA, leaving little proof to support the Minister\u2019s application. [5] The Minister maintains that the Board wrongly excluded relevant evidence, and erroneously concluded that the officer was unaware that Mr Barrios had been granted refugee status; that knowledge would have justified the officer\u2019s questioning. The Board found that the officer learned of Mr Barrios\u2019s refugee status only by way of improper questioning. The Minister asks me to order another panel of the Board to reconsider the cessation application. [6] I agree with the Minister that the Board erred in excluding evidence on the basis that Mr Barrios had been denied his right to counsel. It follows that the Board wrongly excluded relevant evidence. I will, therefore, allow this judicial review and order a new hearing before the Board. It is unnecessary to consider whether the Board also erred in finding that there was no remaining evidence of Mr Barrios\u2019s refugee status. [7] The sole issue is whether the Board erred in its conclusion that Mr Barrios\u2019s right to counsel was violated. II. Was Mr Barrios\u2019s right to counsel violated? [8] The Board found that a person who is the subject of a hearing is entitled to be represented by counsel. Where that right has been violated, said the Board, any evidence acquired as a result of the violation must be disregarded. [9] I can overturn the Board\u2019s conclusion if it was incorrect: Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Paramo de Gutierrez, 2016 FCA 211 at para 44. In my view, the Board\u2019s conclusion was incorrect. The Board relied on the Paramo de Gutierrez decision for the proposition that pre-hearing procedures attract the right to counsel. In fact, that decision does not stand for that proposition. Rather, the Federal Court of Appeal found that the applicants had a right to counsel at an interview conducted a few weeks before the applicants\u2019 hearing before the Board. In that situation, the applicants were the subject of proceedings before the Board and were entitled to be represented by counsel according to s 167 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27. [10] Here, at the time of his interviews, Mr Barrios was not the subject of any proceeding before the Board. He became a subject of proceedings before the Board only after the Minister commenced a cessation application. [11] Further, the jurisprudence is clear that a person is generally not entitled to counsel at interviews or pre-hearing proceedings: Dehghani v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] 1 SCR 1053 at paras 49, 51; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Bermudez, 2016 FCA 131 at para 50; Paramo de Gutierrez (above) at para 54. [12] Accordingly, the Board erred in finding that Mr Barrios had a right to counsel and that the evidence obtained from him should be excluded. I must, therefore, refer the matter back to another panel of the Board for reconsideration. III. Conclusion and Disposition [13] The Board erred in finding that Mr Barrios\u2019s right to counsel had been violated and in excluding evidence taken by CBSA officers. I must, therefore, allow this application for judicial review. Neither party proposed a question of general importance for me to certify, and none is stated. JUDGMENT IN IMM-59-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that the application for judicial review is allowed, and the matter is remitted to another panel of the Board for reconsideration. No question of general importance is stated. \"James W.

In early February 2019, a company offered Mr. Brar a permanent, full-time position as a welder, and he submitted a work permit application shortly thereafter. In May 2019, a visa officer [Officer] conducted an interview with Mr. Brar, and refused the application [Decision]. Mr. Brar now challenges the Decision. For the following reasons, I find that it is reasonable. I. Background [2] Mr. Brar attended the interview with an interpreter. When asked what language he wanted to conduct the interview in, Mr. Brar requested Punjabi. The Officer queried whether English was a job requirement, at which point Mr. Brar indicated he wanted to conduct the interview in English. The interview proceeded in English. The Officer\u2019s Global Case Management System [GCMS] notes detail the interview questions and responses, and provide the reasons for the Officer\u2019s Decision. Some problematic examples from the GCMS notes include that when asked about: what kind of visa he had previously applied for, Mr. Brar responded that he had experience. his education, he said that he had completed a one-year diploma in welding, but later in the interview, Mr. Brar could not answer a question about the duration of his welding program. what he did before completing the welding diploma, Mr. Brar said that he is working and has experience. what kind of work he was doing presently, after the question was repeated, Mr. Brar said that he was a welder, and noted that \u201cthere are many instruments \u2026\u201d what he would do to learn the job duties, Mr. Brar stated that his cousin is working there and that \u201cthis is a good job.\u201d \u00b7 why he brought a letter from his prospective employer to the interview that he did not include in his initial application, Mr. Brar did not respond despite being asked three times. [3] The Officer also noted a concern with Mr. Brar\u2019s pronunciation and failure to itemize all the tasks set out in the job description. [4] At the conclusion of the interview, the Officer advised Mr. Brar that she was concerned that he (i) did not meet the prospective job\u2019s language requirement of spoken English; (ii) was unable to satisfactorily explain the duties that he would be expected to perform in Canada; (iii) had failed to demonstrate that he would be able to perform the work sought; and (iv) would not leave Canada at the end of his authorized stay. The Officer gave Mr. Brar the opportunity to respond to these concerns. He responded: \u201cI can speak \u2026 You can check my work.\u201d The Officer then refused the application. II. Analysis [5] Mr. Brar argues that the Officer erred in concluding that he is unable to perform the work sought and would not leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for his stay under paragraphs 200(3)(a) and 200(1)(b) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations]. Mr. Brar also alleges that the Officer breached his right to procedural fairness. [6] When reviewing the merits of an administrative decision, there is a presumption that the legislature intended the standard of review to be reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para 23 [Vavilov]). This presumption may be rebutted where there is a clear indication of legislative intent or by the rule of law, neither of which is present in this case. [7] The burden is on Mr. Brar to demonstrate unreasonableness (Vavilov at para 100). To determine whether a decision as a whole is reasonable, the reviewing court \u201casks whether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2013 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2013 and whether it is justified in relation to the factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov at para 99; Canada Post Corp v Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67 at para 32 [Canada Post]). To look at it from the other side of the coin, a decision will be unreasonable if the reasons, read in conjunction with the record, do not allow me to understand the Officer\u2019s reasoning on a critical point (Vavilov at para 103). [8] As for issues of procedural fairness, Vavilov maintained the status quo (at paras 23 and 77). Procedural fairness is reviewed under the correctness standard, by considering whether the process was fair and just (Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at para 54; Mission Institution v Khela, 2014 SCC 24 at para 79). A. The Officer reasonably concluded that Mr. Brar did not qualify for a work permit [9] Mr. Brar submits that the Officer\u2019s assessment of his oral English ability was flawed and that, in particular, the Officer did not identify the language level necessary for his job offer, and thus failed to comply with the relevant part of the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada [IRCC] \u201cTemporary Workers\u201d guidelines [Guidelines], at the webpage \u201cForeign workers: Assessing language requirements,\u201d which states: An applicant\u2019s language ability can be assessed through an interview or official testing such as IELTS/TEF or in-house mission testing practice. In deciding to require proof of language ability, the officer\u2019s notes should refer to the LMIA requirements, working conditions as described in the job offer and NOC requirements for the specific occupation, in determining what precise level of language requirement is necessary to perform the work sought. System notes must clearly indicate the officer\u2019s language assessment, and in the case of a refusal, clearly show a detailed analysis on how the applicant failed to satisfy the officer that they would be able to perform the work sought. [10] I do not agree with this submission. While the Officer does not need to be constrained \u2013 or fettered \u2013 by the Guidelines, and is primarily governed by the legislative requirements as set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 and Regulations, the Officer\u2019s Decision was nonetheless consistent with the points raised in these Guidelines: the Decision referenced the International English Second Language Testing System [IELTS] results, assessed Mr. Brar\u2019s language ability over the course of the interview, referred to the Labour Market Impact Assessment [LMIA] requirements and work requirements, and considered his English proficiency in the context of the work to be done. In fact, in the decision to interview Mr. Brar, the Officer noted \u201cPA to be interviewed to assess his stated work experience and english [sic] abilities to be able to read safety instructions as PA\u2019s job involves a high risk to safety.\u201d The GCMS notes, as summarized above in paragraph 2 of these Reasons, provide a detailed indication of areas where the language fell short. The Officer concluded, based on these findings, that Mr. Brar would not be able to adequately perform the work sought. [11] Mr. Brar further argues that the only job duty concerning language ability pertains to the interpretation of welding process specifications, which engages his reading, not verbal, proficiency. I do not agree that the only relevant language skill required was his ability to read English. First, the LMIA provides that both written and verbal English were required for this particular employment. The Officer\u2019s reference to \u201cverbal English\u201d reflects that the assessment was conducted with this requirement in mind. [12] Furthermore, the job offer states that the job duties \u201cinclude\u201d interpreting welding process specifications and operating various equipment, amongst several other tasks. This language suggests that the offer does not provide an exhaustive list of job duties. While the other job requirements listed tend to be more operational in nature (i.e. operating various machines and processes), they certainly do not rule out verbal English as a basic requirement. [13] Ultimately, officers must make their own determinations of the abilities based on the evidence and, here, the Officer simply placed more weight on the real-time interview with Mr. Brar than test scores. An officer\u2019s findings of language proficiency under paragraph 200(3)(a) are both factual and discretionary (Singh Grewal v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 627 at para 17 [Grewal]; Sulce v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1132 at para 8 [Sulce]). As such, I find that the Officer\u2019s determinations of language proficiency were reasonable in this case. [14] Finally, Mr. Brar argues that his IELTS scores should just suffice for a work permit because they satisfy the Canadian Language Benchmarks for the Federal Skilled Trades Program. While that may well be, determinations under the Temporary Foreign Worker program fall under a different regulatory regime than those for the Federal Skilled Worker Class and accordingly entail different considerations (Grewal at para 16). Officers are thus entitled to consider a number of factors in reaching a conclusion on the language proficiency required by the job and demonstrated by the applicant. They should certainly take language testing into account, just as the Officer did here. However, where a basic lack of comprehension emerges, the legislation posits the discretion to make a final determination in the hands of the officer under paragraph 200(3)(a) of the Regulations. [15] I do concede that there were two areas in which the Officer overreached in finding problems relating to language skills \u2013 that Mr. Brar failed to list all of the duties listed in the job offer letter and that he misclassified his job interviewer as the owner of the company rather than its vice president. While I find that both of these concerns, in isolation, are microscopic in nature (i.e. Mr. Brar described several key tasks, and did not have to know the precise role of his interviewer), these two shortcomings do not render the Decision unreasonable overall. [16] Rather, when read as a whole, the Decision is reasonable, particularly because the Officer based the decision on language skills, detailing non-responses and lack of comprehension. The Officer justified the decision, and transparently explained why Mr. Brar did not satisfy the requirements for the work permit. In sum, Mr. Brar has not satisfied his onus to demonstrate to the Court that the Decision was unreasonable. The reasons, while understandably concise given the context of a visa office decisions, allow me to clearly understand. [17] In addition, Mr. Brar submits that the Officer unreasonably failed to provide any rationale to support the conclusion that he would not leave Canada by the end of the authorized period. [18] The Officer\u2019s conclusion bears some similarity to Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 115 [Singh], in which this Court determined that such a finding on temporary intent was reasonable when viewed contextually: when one considers the fact that the Officer\u2019s finding is that Mr. Brar would not be able to fulfil the job duties, it follows that he would not be able to fulfill the terms of his temporary residence status (see Singh at para 23). B. The Officer did not breach Mr. Brar\u2019s right to procedural fairness [19] Mr. Brar attended the interview with an interpreter because the letter requesting he take part in the interview stated that applicants who do not speak fluent English or French must attend with an interpreter. He deposes that the Officer dissuaded him from using the interpreter by saying: \u201cDon\u2019t waste my time if you are unable to speak English,\u201d and argues that by doing so, the Officer breached Mr. Brar\u2019s right to procedural fairness. [20] For the reasons stated above, I cannot agree that discouraging Mr. Brar from using an interpreter constituted a breach of procedural fairness. Had the situation been different, such as an interview for refugee protection or humanitarian relief, there may well have been a breach. [21] However, a primary purpose of the interview was to assess Mr. Brar\u2019s ability to satisfy the requirements of his prospective work, which included English language skills. [22] Furthermore, I note that the level of procedural fairness owed in the context of temporary work permit applications is low and generally does not require that temporary work permit applicants be granted an opportunity to address the visa officer\u2019s concerns (Singh at para 25; Sulce at para 10). Indeed, there was no breach of procedural fairness found in either Singh or Sulce despite neither applicant having received an opportunity to address the visa officer\u2019s concerns. Here, to Mr. Brar\u2019s benefit, the Officer did grant such an opportunity, and accordingly satisfied the procedural fairness requirements. III. Conclusion [23] While the Decision had some imperfections, these shortcomings are not \u201csufficiently serious\u201d to undermine the reasonability of the Decision as a whole (Vavilov at para 100 and Canada Post at para 33). The Decision provides sufficient justification to support the Officer\u2019s finding regarding Mr. Brar\u2019s limited English language skills. Throughout the interview, the Officer had to repeat questions and Mr. Brar clearly had difficulties responding. I find the conclusion to be reasonable. Nor do I find any breach of procedural fairness. For these reasons, I am dismissing this judicial review. JUDGMENT in IMM-3128-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: 1. This application for judicial review is dismissed. 2. No questions for certification were argued, and I agree none arise. 3. There is no award as to costs. \"Alan S.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200103 Docket: IMM-1452-19 Citation: 2020 FC 9 [UNREVISED CERTIFIED ENGLISH TRANSLATION] Ottawa, Ontario, January 3, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Pentney BETWEEN: JILLERT AUGUSTE Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] Jillert Auguste is seeking judicial review of a decision by an officer rejecting his pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) application. The applicant argues that the officer breached his duty of procedural fairness by not giving him a hearing and that the decision is unreasonable given the evidence on the record. [2] The applicant is a citizen of Haiti. He arrived at the border between the United States and Canada on July 9, 2017, and made a claim for refugee protection. Because he was coming from the United States, his claim was determined to be ineligible. A few days later, the applicant returned to Canada via another port of entry and made a claim for refugee protection that was also determined to be ineligible. He then filed a PRRA application. [3] In his PRRA application, the applicant stated that he was involved in the ODECHA committee, an organization for the development of the residential area of Charrier in the town of Les Cayes, where the applicant resided. During the elections of October 26, 2016, ODECHA reportedly met with a man named Tiblanc, a representative of Jean Gabriel Fortun\u00e9, a powerful man in the area. The applicant did not think that ODECHA should support Mr. Fortun\u00e9. When the latter won the election, a group contested the results, and Mr. Fortun\u00e9 allegedly believed that the applicant was responsible. [4] On May 5, 2017, men connected with Mr. Fortun\u00e9 purportedly went to the applicant\u2019s house. They fired projectiles, hit the applicant and his wife and children and tore the door off the house. They stated that anybody who did not want Mr. Fortun\u00e9 to be mayor would have to leave Les Cayes. The applicant filed a complaint with a justice of the peace, and his counsel filed a complaint with the police. The applicant left his house to hide in the forest. He then left Haiti for the United States. [5] On June 23, 2017, while the applicant was in the United States, his wife called to tell him that Mr. Fortun\u00e9\u2019s group had returned to his house to kill him. She therefore told him not to return. Counsel for the applicant filed another complaint with the police, stating that a group of men had come to the applicant\u2019s house looking for him. They said that as long as Mr. Fortun\u00e9\u2019s political group was in power, the applicant could not return to live in Les Cayes. According to the complaint, the applicant\u2019s family was forced to abandon his house. [6] Despite the limited amount of information provided by the applicant, the PRRA officer accepted the possibility that the facts he had alleged had indeed occurred. He therefore gave the applicant the benefit of the doubt in his assessment. The officer noted that the gist of the alleged threats was that the applicant would suffer reprisals if did not leave the town of Les Cayes. The officer accepted that the applicant might be threatened in Les Cayes but determined that the applicant had failed to explain why he could not live elsewhere in Haiti. There was no evidence that Mr. Fortun\u00e9 or his group could have searched the entire country for him. The officer concluded that the applicant had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution or a risk to his personal safety or his life, as provided by sections 96 or 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. [7] The applicant is seeking judicial review of that decision. He raises two issues: (i) whether the officer should have summoned the applicant to a hearing; and (ii) whether the decision was unreasonable with respect to its handling of the evidence. [8] The standard of review applicable to the issues in this case is reasonableness: A.B. v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 165 at paras 10\u201311; Shaikh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1318 at para 16. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] does not change this. In the circumstances of this case, and considering paragraph 144 of Vavilov, it is not necessary to request submissions from the parties on the appropriate standard or its application. As in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Canada Post Corp v Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67 at para 24, \u201c[n]o unfairness arises from [the application of the framework established in Vavilov to this case] as the applicable standard of review and the result would have been the same under the Dunsmuir framework\u201d. [9] The applicant argues that the officer should have summoned him to a hearing because he determined that there was an internal flight alternative (IFA). The claimant refers to the officer\u2019s conclusion: [translation] \u201cThe applicant does not allege, and the evidence does not demonstrate, that his assailants have any interest whatsoever in tracking him down if he were to return to Haiti and settle in another city\u201d. The officer did not inform the applicant that he had questions regarding an IFA. The claimant submits that in such circumstances, the law requires the officer to hold a hearing: Sandhu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 759. [10] I do not find this argument persuasive. Generally, a PRRA is made on the basis of written submissions: subsection 161(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations]. However, paragraph 113(b) of the IRPA provides that a hearing may be held if the officer, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that a hearing is required. Section 167 of the Regulations sets out the three prescribed factors, including whether there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant\u2019s credibility, whether the evidence is central to the decision and whether the evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection. The three factors are cumulative: Sallai v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 446, at para 46 [Sallai], citing Demirovic v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1284, at paras 9\u201310. [11] In this case, the officer did not base his decision on issues relating to the applicant\u2019s credibility. The officer stated that he had given the applicant the benefit of the doubt. Moreover, the decision on the IFA issue is based on the insufficiency of the applicant\u2019s evidence. The officer held that [translation] \u201ceven if the alleged facts did occur, they are an insufficient basis for granting refugee protection to the applicant\u201d. [12] Therefore, there is no reason to conduct a hearing pursuant to section 167 of the Regulations because the applicant\u2019s credibility is not at issue and the officer\u2019s conclusion is based on the insufficiency of the evidence: see Sallai, at paras 58\u201363, Gul v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 812 at paras 23\u201331; Zdraviak v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 305 at para 18. [13] The applicant argues that the decision is unreasonable because the evidence does not support the officer\u2019s conclusion that the threats were limited to the town of Les Cayes. The applicant points out that he was threatened by a powerful politician in Haiti and that it is unreasonable to conclude that the threats are limited to his town of residence. The officer did not challenge his credibility and therefore his sworn statement must be accepted. The officer also erred in criticizing the applicant for not having tried to present new evidence regarding the situation of his wife and child after he fled Haiti, considering the brief period between the events and the assessment of his PRRA application. [14] The applicant also submits that the decision is unreasonable because the officer did not take into account the documents he filed that were in Creole and gave him no opportunity to explain them. [15] I disagree. First, it should be noted that this is a judicial review of a discretionary decision by an immigration officer. The applicable standard of review is reasonableness. Under this standard, the Court\u2019s role is to determine whether the decision falls within \u201ca range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\u201d (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 at para 47). As long as \u201cthe process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility,\u201d it is not open to this Court to substitute its own view of a preferable outcome (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC at para 59). I note that this approach was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Vavilov at paragraphs 81\u201387 and that the analysis in the decision at issue here adheres to the standards set out in Vavilov. [16] The officer\u2019s assessment of the evidence must be afforded a degree of deference by the Court. In this case, the evidence filed indicates that a group threatened the applicant with reprisals if he continued to live in Les Cayes. To use the applicant\u2019s own words, he wrote in his complaint of May 8, 2017, that Mr. Tiblanc\u2019s men had told him that [translation] \u201canybody who does not want Gabriel [Fortun\u00e9] as Magistrate must leave the Commune of Les Cayes\u201d. The officer did not doubt that the applicant had been threatened, and he based his assessment of the seriousness of the threat on the allegations in the application. The officer cannot be criticized for attributing weight to the applicant\u2019s own words. [17] The applicant filed a few documents in Creole in support of his application without providing translations. The applicant submits that the officer should have given him an opportunity to explain them. I disagree. The Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada\u2019s guide to applying for a PRRA, which the applicant received according to the evidence on the record, clearly states that any documents filed must be provided in either English or French and that applicants must provide a translation of any documents in another language. PRRA officers are not required to ask applicants to send them translations of the documents: Joseph v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1276 at para 14. Applicants have the burden of placing before the PRRA officer all the evidence necessary to support their allegations. [18] It is not unreasonable for the officer to take into account the applicant\u2019s story regarding the threats or to attribute no weight to the untranslated documents. [19] In conclusion, I should note that the applicant himself prepared the written documents in support of his application for judicial review but was represented by counsel at the hearing. I granted his counsel some leeway to present arguments that went somewhat beyond those presented in the written submissions. I would like to highlight the cooperation and professionalism of counsel for the applicant and for the Attorney General. [20] The application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question of general importance to certify. JUDGMENT in IMM-1452-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is as follows: The application for judicial review is dismissed.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200121 Docket: IMM-2527-19 Citation: 2020 FC 85 Ottawa, Ontario, January 21, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Manson BETWEEN: BERTALAN ALADAR GALAMB Applicant and MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Introduction [1] This is an application for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [RAD] confirming the decision of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] that the Applicant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection pursuant to section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. II. Background [2] The Applicant is a Hungarian citizen of Romani ethnicity. He has a grade eight education, and a history of part-time employment. Before coming to Canada, he lived in Miskolc, Hungary, and claims that he suffered discrimination when looking for employment based on his ethnicity. [3] In 2011, three individuals attacked the Applicant such that he needed medical attention. He received the necessary medical attention, and filed a police report, but the police were not able to identify his attackers. [4] The Applicant claims that when his daughter gave birth to her child in Hungary, she was placed in a segregated maternity ward and given little attention. [5] The Applicant separated from his wife in 2014, and subsequently had difficulty finding housing. He temporarily lived with his sister in Miskolc from 2014 to 2015, but the government evicted them in preparation for demolition of their housing complex as part of an upgrade to a nearby football stadium. [6] The Applicant came to Canada in 2016, and submitted a claim for refugee protection. [7] The RPD rejected the Applicant\u2019s claim on November 20, 2016, finding that the Applicant is neither a convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. The RPD found that the Applicant was not a credible witness because he testified before the RPD that he visited the Minority Ombudsman in Hungary to seek assistance, but neglected to state this in his basis of claim form [BOC]. The RPD found that this amounted to a material omission that undermined his credibility. [8] The Applicant appealed to the RAD. In a decision dated June 7, 2017, the RAD endorsed the RPD\u2019s negative credibility finding, and confirmed the RPD decision pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA [2017 RAD Decision]. [9] The Applicant applied for judicial review of the RAD decision. In a decision dated February 6, 2018, Justice Campbell granted the application and remitted the matter back to the RAD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel (Galamb v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 135 [Galamb]). Justice Campbell found that the RAD made an invalid negative credibility finding, and set the decision aside as unreasonable on this basis alone. III. Decision Under Review [10] In a decision dated March 26, 2019, a different member of the RAD reconsidered the Applicant\u2019s appeal in accordance with the Court\u2019s reasons in Galamb [2019 RAD Decision]. The RAD again confirmed the RPD\u2019s decision pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the IRPA. [11] The RAD considered the Applicant\u2019s request to admit the following additional documents: 1. An affidavit of the Applicant, dated April 18, 2018, including country condition documents attached as exhibits. 2. An affidavit of the Applicant\u2019s sister, dated April 18, 2018, with a translated copy of the eviction notice from her housing in Miskolc attached as an exhibit. [12] The RAD admitted the Applicant\u2019s affidavit and the documents attached thereto. The attached documents were all dated after November 20, 2016\u2014the date on which the RPD rejected the Applicant\u2019s claim\u2014and therefore were admissible pursuant to subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. [13] The RAD did not admit the affidavit of the Applicant\u2019s sister. The information contained in the affidavit pertaining to matters that occurred before the RPD rejected the Applicant\u2019s claim was inadmissible for non-compliance with subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. The RAD found the Applicant reasonably could have presented this information before the RPD, but did not. [14] The information in the sister\u2019s affidavit that arose after November 20, 2016\u2014namely that the sister\u2019s son was found to be a convention refugee in Canada in 2018\u2014complied with subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. However, the RAD found that this information was not relevant to the Applicant\u2019s claim, as each refugee claim is decided on its particular facts. Therefore, this information was inadmissible for irrelevance (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Singh, 2016 FCA 96 at para 38 [Singh]). [15] The RAD did not reconsider whether the RPD\u2019s credibility finding was incorrect, noting \u201cJustice Campbell of the Federal Court has, in effect, ruled that it was.\u201d Accordingly, the RAD considered all of the Applicant\u2019s testimony as true. However, the RAD went on to state that a finding that the Applicant is a credible witness does not mean that the RAD must accept all of his evidence as accurate. Rather, the Applicant\u2019s testimony on certain issues may represent his perception rather than the objective truth. [16] The RAD considered the aspects of life where the Applicant claimed to suffer discrimination because of being a Roma. The evidence established that the Applicant suffered discrimination in employment, housing, and generally, but did not suffer discrimination in education, healthcare, or social security. After considering the distinction between discrimination and persecution as described in the United Nations High Commission for Refugees Handbook [UNHCR Handbook], the RAD concluded that the Applicant\u2019s treatment in relation to his employment, housing, and generally was discriminatory and deeply regrettable, but did not rise to the level of persecution. [17] Finally, the RAD considered whether there was a serious possibility that the Applicant would suffer persecution in Hungary based on his profile as a Roma. The RAD adopted the state protection analysis from the 2017 RAD Decision as part of its decision, finding the analysis to be thorough, clear, and accurate. However, because that analysis was undertaken in 2017, the RAD went on to consider whether any of the more recent documents submitted by the Applicant affected the state protection analysis. [18] The RAD gave a brief overview of the supplementary documents, and concluded that these new documents, like those considered by the previous RAD panel, were mixed. The RAD found there was no evidence that the Hungarian Prime Minister\u2019s discriminatory rhetoric had led to an increase in discrimination or persecution against Hungarian Roma, or a reduction in the level of democracy in Hungary. [19] Accordingly, the RAD concluded that there was no serious possibility that the Applicant would be persecuted upon return to Hungary, and that on a balance of probabilities, the Applicant would not be subjected to harm as described in subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. IV. Issues [20] The issues are: (1) Did the RAD err in excluding the affidavit of the Applicant\u2019s sister? (2) Did the RAD err in assessing whether the Applicant\u2019s experiences of discrimination cumulatively amount to persecution on a forward-looking basis? (3) Was the RAD\u2019s state protection analysis reasonable? V. Standard of Review [21] The parties filed their memoranda prior to issuance of the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decisions in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] and Bell Canada v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66. [22] In their initial submissions, the parties agreed that the standard of review for all of the issues raised is reasonableness (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93 at para 35 [Huruglica]). [23] The Court sent a direction to the parties giving them the opportunity to submit additional written representations on the standard of review and application of that standard. Counsel for the parties made additional representations having regard to Vavilov on January 10, 2020. [24] Pursuant to Vavilov, when a court is reviewing the merits of an administrative decision, the presumptive standard of review is reasonableness (Vavilov, above at para 23). The Supreme Court identified two types of situations where this presumption can be rebutted (Vavilov at para 32). In the present case, neither situation applies. The presumption of reasonableness governs for the issues before this Court. [25] The focus on review is the \u201cdecision actually made by the decision maker including both the decision maker\u2019s reasoning and the outcome\u201d (Vavilov at para 83). [26] A decision is reasonable if it \u201cis one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d (Vavilov at para 85). [27] Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA defines what evidence may be presented to the RAD on appeal: 110 (4) On appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection. VI. Analysis A. Did the RAD err in excluding the affidavit of the Applicant\u2019s sister? [28] Before the RAD, the Applicant was entitled to introduce evidence that arose after the RPD rejected his claim, or evidence that he could not reasonably have been expected to have presented at the time of the rejection (IRPA, s 110(4)). To be admissible, evidence must also be credible and relevant (Singh, above at paras 38-49). [29] With respect to the information in the sister\u2019s affidavit that pre-dates the RPD hearing, the Applicant argues that he could not reasonably have been expected to provide this information at the RPD hearing. The Applicant\u2019s argument appears to be that in the first judicial review before this Court, Justice Campbell found that the RPD and the RAD did not have valid reasons to doubt the Applicant\u2019s credibility and require corroborative evidence for aspects of his claim. To support his claim, the Applicant submitted his testimony, BOC narrative, and country condition evidence. Because he submitted this evidence, he could not have reasonably been expected to also provide corroborating evidence from his sister. Therefore, in refusing to admit these aspects of the sister\u2019s affidavit, the RAD effectively required corroborating evidence from the Applicant. [30] The Applicant\u2019s argument conflates the test on credibility with the rule on admitting new evidence before the RAD. The evidence that pre-dated the RPD rejecting the Applicant\u2019s claim was reasonably available to him, but he decided not to submit an affidavit from his sister at that time, despite bearing the onus to establish his claim. If the Applicant felt his sister\u2019s affidavit would assist in making out his claim, he reasonably could have presented it before the RPD. In considering new evidence, the RAD is not required to provide the Applicant with an opportunity to correct deficiencies in the record submitted before the RPD (Singh at para 54). [31] The RAD also found the information that post-dated the RPD hearing was irrelevant, and therefore inadmissible. Specifically, the RAD found the fact that the sister\u2019s son became a Convention refugee in Canada on March 23, 2018 was not relevant to the Applicant\u2019s claim. While the sister\u2019s son also had difficulty obtaining employment, and was evicted from the sister\u2019s home in Miskolc, the RAD found this was an insufficient link to the Applicant\u2019s situation to establish relevance. [32] I find that the RAD reasonably excluded the post-RPD hearing evidence. The only evidence in the sister\u2019s affidavit related to her son was that he was evicted from her house, had faced difficulty in securing employment, and had received a positive refugee determination in Canada in 2018. While the affidavit states that authorization to access the son\u2019s Canadian refugee file is attached as an exhibit, no such exhibit is attached. Because the RAD must consider each claim individually, the RAD reasonably found the facts related to the sister\u2019s son were irrelevant to the Applicant\u2019s claim. Evidence of similarly situated individuals is contained in the National Documentation Package [NDP] documents and the additional objective evidence submitted by the Applicant. [33] The RAD\u2019s exclusion of the sister\u2019s affidavit was reasonable. B. Did the RAD err in assessing whether the Applicant\u2019s experiences of discrimination cumulatively amount to persecution on a forward-looking basis? [34] The Applicant makes two main arguments on this issue. First, the Applicant argues that the RAD failed to explain why the discrimination he faced did not amount to persecution, and therefore the decision lacks transparency. The Applicant\u2019s position is that the RAD merely stated the difference between discrimination and persecution as described in the UNHCR Handbook, and then concluded that the Applicant\u2019s treatment did not meet the threshold for persecution. Absent a more fulsome analysis, the Applicant argues that the RAD failed to explain why the discriminatory incidents he experienced did not amount to persecution. [35] When read as a whole, the RAD\u2019s reasons for finding that the discrimination experienced by the Applicant did not rise to the level of persecution are transparent and intelligible. The RAD considered each aspect of the Applicant\u2019s life in which he claimed to have experienced hardship. The RAD found that the Applicant\u2019s difficulty finding a job was in part due to his Roma ethnicity, but found that his limited education was also a factor. Therefore, while discrimination was a factor, the fact that the Applicant only worked intermittently was not solely attributable to discrimination. [36] The RAD also found that the Applicant\u2019s difficulty finding housing was in part attributable to discrimination. However, other factors also contributed to the Applicant\u2019s unstable housing situation, including the breakdown of his marriage, a lack of steady employment, and the government decision to demolish the housing unit where his sister lived. [37] The RAD found that the Applicant did not establish that he experienced discrimination in education, health care, and social security. [38] The Applicant submitted evidence that he was insulted and followed in public on the presumption he was a thief, and that police in Hungary target dark-skinned people. In 2011, he was attacked by three individuals who used anti-Roma slurs. The RAD found that the attack was a one-off incident that did not form part of a larger pattern, but that nonetheless the Applicant had established that he suffered general discrimination by non-Roma in Hungary. [39] The RAD\u2019s detailed consideration of each aspect of the Applicant\u2019s discrimination claim shows that the RAD was alive to the relationship between discrimination and persecution, and considered the cumulative effects of the discrimination the Applicant suffered. However, the RAD also found that factors other than discrimination contributed to the hardships suffered by the Applicant in Hungary, and that his treatment did not meet the threshold for persecution. When read as a whole, the RAD\u2019s consideration of the Applicant\u2019s past experiences in Hungary was reasonable. [40] Second, the Applicant argues that the RAD ignored country condition evidence that supported his claim of a forward-looking risk. The Applicant submits that the RAD failed to adequately consider the country condition evidence to determine whether his subjective fear of persecution had an objective evidentiary basis. The RAD did not refer to the country condition evidence in its reasons, and did not explicitly discuss the interdependence of discrimination in employment, housing, social security, and education. [41] The Applicant also argues that the RAD erred by failing to consider evidence of indirect discrimination, such as severe underemployment of the Roma population, and the government eviction policy that indirectly discriminated against the high percentage of Romani living in the condemned housing. [42] The Applicant further submits that the RAD concluded that his experience looking for housing was not discriminatory, and was merely the result of enactment of a government policy. However, the RAD\u2019s reasons explicitly state that the Applicant\u2019s inability to find a rental unit was in part attributable to discrimination. [43] The Applicant also alleges the RAD found his perception that most police officers were racist against Roma people was not credible, and that the RAD criticised him for not having specialized knowledge of systemic discrimination in Hungary. However, the RAD stated that while the Applicant was accepted as a credible witness, his testimony that most police were racist against Roma people did not necessarily represent the objective truth, as the Applicant did not have any specialized knowledge or objective evidence to support his claim. This was a reasonable observation. It does not amount to a finding that the Applicant was not credible, or a criticism of his knowledge. [44] Both panels of the RAD considered that the determinative issue in the prospective persecution analysis was the availability of state protection. The RAD\u2019s failure to mention objective evidence or discuss the interdependence of different types of discrimination at an earlier point in its reasons does not indicate that the RAD did not consider the objective evidence in question. [45] I find that the determinative issue in this application is whether the RAD\u2019s state protection analysis was reasonable. C. Was the RAD\u2019s state protection analysis reasonable? [46] The Applicant submits that the RAD\u2019s state protection analysis was unreasonable because it erred in rejecting his sister\u2019s affidavit evidence, and because the RAD failed to conduct an independent assessment of the record on the state protection issue. Given that I find that the RAD reasonably excluded the sister\u2019s affidavit, the remaining issues are whether the RAD failed to conduct an independent assessment of the record, and if not, whether the RAD reasonably concluded that adequate state protection in Hungary would be forthcoming should the Applicant seek it. [47] The RAD adopted the state protection analysis from the 2017 RAD Decision as part of its decision, finding the analysis to be thorough, clear, and accurate. The Applicant submits that by doing so, the RAD failed to conduct an independent assessment of the record, instead deferring to the impugned 2017 RAD Decision. The Applicant argues that the RAD is required to conduct an independent assessment of the record, based on the RAD\u2019s role as an appellate tribunal (Huruglica, above at para 103). [48] While Huruglica speaks to the standard of the review when the RAD is reviewing decisions of the RPD, it does not preclude the RAD from adopting an analysis from a prior panel on redetermination. The 2019 RAD Decision clearly states that the RAD was not deferring to the 2017 RAD Decision, and was not bound by the previous state protection findings. Rather, the new RAD panel was \u201cstruck by the thoroughness, clarity and accuracy\u201d of the earlier state protection analysis, and accordingly adopted it as part of the 2019 RAD Decision. [49] The RAD conducted an independent analysis, adopting what it found to be a thorough analysis of the objective evidence as of 2017. So long as the invalid negative credibility finding did not taint that analysis, and the state protection analysis in the 2017 RAD Decision itself was justified, transparent, and intelligible, the RAD reasonably exercised its discretion to adopt the previous panel\u2019s reasoning. [50] Dealing with the substance of the RAD\u2019s state protection analysis, the focus should be on \u201coperational effectiveness, rather than a state\u2019s good intentions, best efforts and/or aspirations to protect its citizens\u201d (Sokoli v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1072 at paras 18-19). The experiences of similarly situated individuals can provide evidence that state protection will not be forthcoming on a forward-looking basis (Canada (Attorney General) v Ward, [1993] 2 SCR 689). [51] I find that the RAD failed to consider whether Hungary\u2019s efforts have translated into operationally adequate state protection, and failed to consider objective evidence of systemic problems contained in the record. After adopting the 2017 RAD Decision\u2019s state protection analysis, the RAD merely summarized the new articles submitted without providing any analysis or conclusion on what impact the information in the articles would have on his future risk of persecution. [52] The RAD also appears to have ignored evidence in the record that demonstrates that the rule of law in Hungary has eroded (August 31, 2017 NDP for Hungary, Item 9.2). This report, dated November 2016, concludes that the constitutional and judicial system are no longer able to effectively respond to threats to the rule of law in Hungary, due to systematic weakening of these counterbalances by the state. This Court has held that strong language such as this deserves full consideration and analysis by decision makers; systematic erosion of the rule of law implies that anti-discrimination laws may not be followed, and the democratic institution from which state protection arises may be compromised (Olah v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2017 FC 899 at para 22). [53] The Minister argues that the Applicant failed to provide sufficient evidence that he faced a prospective risk of persecution based on his profile as a Roma. The Minister relies on recent jurisprudence of this Court for the principle that \u201cthe mere fact of being of Roma ethnicity in Hungary is not, in and of itself, suf\ufb01cient to establish that an applicant faces more than a mere possibility of persecution upon return\u201d (Bozik v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1469). The RAD concluded that there had not been an increase in discrimination or persecution against Hungarian Roma, and the Applicant did not provide a sufficient link between the documentary evidence and his specific circumstances. [54] The RAD claimed to have accepted the Applicant\u2019s testimony as credible, with the qualification that at times his testimony reflected his perception, rather than the objective truth. However, in adopting the 2017 RAD Decision state protection analysis, the RAD adopted a finding that if the Applicant were to return to Hungary and encounter problems in education, employment, healthcare, housing, or access to business establishments, recourse would be available to him. This finding contradicts the Applicant\u2019s testimony that he sought assistance from the Minority Ombudsman to address police misconduct, and did not receive help. Once the RAD accepted the Applicant\u2019s testimony as credible, there should have been some explanation of why recourse would be available in future, despite this not being the case in the Applicant\u2019s past experience. [55] The RAD was also \u201cstruck by the thoroughness, clarity and accuracy\u201d of the earlier state protection analysis. However, parts of the adopted state protection analysis contain nonsensical sentence fragments that are unintelligible (2017 RAD Decision, at paras 50-51). The 2017 RAD Decision details homicide rates, including those committed using firearms, in Hungary and Canada, noting that in 2009, the rate of homicides committed using firearms was lower in Hungary than in Canada. That comparison is irrelevant to the Applicant\u2019s claim. [56] The RAD further commented on a report that indicates that discrimination against Roma in Hungary continues, largely by satellites of the Jobbik party. However, during the 2018 parliamentary election, while support for the Jobbik party \u201cfizzled\u201d, as the Jobbik party attempted to moderate its behaviour and move away from xenophobic and hateful messaging, the ruling Fidesz party successfully pandered to nationalists through increasingly racist rhetoric. Rather than establish that Jobbik, the political party formerly backed by extremist groups, had lost power in the 2018 election, the article actually describes how Fidesz, the current governing party, successfully used a nationalist campaign to attract these same supporters. [57] Finally, the 2019 RAD Decision does not mention any documents from the NDP for Hungary that post-date the 2017 RAD Decision. Although the RAD member did indicate that documents in the NDP for Hungary were already before him, no such documents are mentioned in the state protection analysis. [58] The RAD is under a duty to consider the most recent country conditions and while the RAD is not required to refer to every piece of evidence, and is presumed to have considered all the evidence before it unless demonstrated otherwise, the RAD\u2019s failure to mention any of the important contradictory evidence contained in the most recent NDP for Hungary constitutes a reviewable error (Cepeda-Gutierrez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 8667 at paras 14-17). [59] The RAD merely states the \u201cnew documents\u201d are mixed, and concludes there is no evidence of an increase in discrimination or persecution against Hungarian Roma or a diminution in the \u201clevel of democracy\u201d of the state. The objective evidence in the August 31, 2017 NDP for Hungary suggests that the rule of law in Hungary has been systematically eroded by the current government, and the RAD specifically found that the current Prime Minister has engaged in discrimination rhetoric. Accordingly, as in Olah, above, a reasonably justified decision would have addressed the specific evidence pointing towards a decrease in the level of democracy in the country. The RAD failed to do so. JUDGMENT in IMM-2527-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that The application is allowed and the matter is referred to a different RAD member for reconsideration.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200102 Docket: IMM-4056-19 Citation: 2020 FC 4 Ottawa, Ontario, January 2, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Lafreni\u00e8re BETWEEN: LUIS FELIPE GARCES CACERES Applicant and THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] The Applicant, Luis Felipe Garces Caceres, seeks judicial review of the decision of the Immigration Appeal Division [IAD] dated May 30, 2019 [the Decision] setting aside the decision of the Immigration Division [ID] dated March 9, 2018. [2] The IAD allowed the appeal of the Respondent, the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness [Minister], and determined the Applicant to be inadmissible to Canada on the ground of membership in an organization, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC], pursuant to paragraph 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. [3] The Applicant submits there was a breach of procedural fairness because the IAD made a disguised credibility finding without an oral hearing. He also argues that the IAD\u2019s weighing of evidence was unreasonable. [4] For the reasons that follow, the application for judicial review is dismissed. II. Facts [5] The Applicant is a citizen of Colombia. In April 2017, he arrived in Canada and made an inland claim for refugee status. [6] After sending the Applicant\u2019s fingerprints to US authorities, the Canada Border Services Agency [CBSA] was informed that the Applicant was on a list of FARC members. [7] The Applicant was interviewed by a hearings advisor with the CBSA [CBSA Officer] on July 21 and August 11, 2017. The interviews were conducted with the assistance of a Spanish interpreter. [8] The Applicant told the CBSA Officer that he was a young, unemployed person in Colombia. When questioned whether he was ever a member of FARC, the Applicant admitted that he declared himself to Colombian authorities in 2007 as a member but claimed he was never a real member. The Applicant explained that in January 2007, he was approached by police and a FARC member and taken to work at a sawmill with 30 other young men. The group was provided uniforms to make it seem as though they were FARC members. The Applicant stated that after a month, he was registered as a demobilized FARC member and obtained a monthly allowance upon his surrender. According to the Applicant, he was just pretending (\u201cfalso positivo\u201d) to be a FARC member in order to receive the \ufb01nancial bene\ufb01ts the government was offering. [9] On August 18, 2017, the CBSA initiated an admissibility hearing against the Applicant pursuant to paragraph 34(l)(f) of the IRPA. His refugee claim was suspended in the interim. A. Immigration Division Decision [10] On March 9, 2018, the ID held the admissibility hearing. No witnesses were called. The parties relied instead on documentary evidence, including transcripts of the Applicant\u2019s interviews with the CBSA Officer, statutory declarations of the Applicant\u2019s ex-spouse, former employer, and former co-worker and newspaper articles. [11] At the end of the hearing, the ID member rendered an oral decision. The member noted that there was no indication on the record before him as to how the US authorities concluded that the Applicant was a member of FARC. The member went on to find that the story the Applicant told to the CBSA Officer was believable and consistent with documents showing that Colombia was trying at the time to weed out fake FARC members that were demobilized. The ID member concluded that the Minister had failed to prove his case and accordingly ruled in the Applicant\u2019s favour. B. Immigration Appeal Division Decision [12] The Minister appealed the ID\u2019s decision to the IAD pursuant to subsection 63(5) of the IRPA. [13] On November 28, 2018, counsel for the parties held a pre-hearing conference with the IAD member assigned to hear the appeal. Counsel for the Minister indicated that a package of additional documents had already been provided. Both counsel confirmed that an oral hearing was not needed as they would not be calling any additional witnesses and would be relying on the evidence and submissions presented before the ID. The IAD member advised she would be making her own credibility assessment and fixed a timetable for final or supplemental written submissions. [14] There was no dispute before the IAD that the Applicant was neither a Canadian citizen nor a permanent resident. The parties also agreed that FARC is or was an organization as de\ufb01ned in paragraphs 34(1)(b), (b.1) or (c) of the IRPA. The only issue to be determined by the IAD was whether the Applicant was a member of FARC, including considerations of duress. [15] The IAD member concluded that given the speci\ufb01c relief provided in subsection 42.1(1) of the IRPA to a person found to be a member of an organization, the issue of duress or coercion should not be considerations in the determination of membership. She found that membership in an organization under paragraph 34(1)(f) should continue to be given a broad interpretation because of public safety and national security concerns and that the issue of duress should instead be a consideration for exemption from inadmissibility under subsection 42.1(1). The IAD member concluded that, in any event, the Applicant could not rely on duress as he did not appear to face serious and imminent physical harm when he decided to declare himself as a member of FARC, nor was there any evidence of attempts to leave the situation. He chose instead to continue receiving financial benefits for over a year as a demobilized member. [16] The IAD member found there was sufficient credible evidence to conclude that there were reasonable grounds to believe the Applicant was a member of FARC. She gave limited weight to the statutory declarations of the Applicant\u2019s former employer and ex-spouse declaring that the Applicant was not a member of a criminal organization or FARC on the basis that the former employer did not appear to have any knowledge of the Applicant\u2019s declaration as a demobilized FARC member and that his ex-spouse stated that they began their relationship at the time he became a demobilized FARC member. She placed greater weight on the documentary evidence confirming the Applicant\u2019s membership in FARC and the Applicant\u2019s own declaration to the Colombian authorities that he was a member. III. Issues [17] The Applicant raises two issues: Whether the IAD breached procedural fairness? Whether the IAD\u2019s analysis of his evidence was unreasonable? IV. Standard of Review [18] At the hearing of the application on December 18, 2019, the parties agreed that the standard of review for an alleged breach of procedural fairness is correctness. This standard requires the Court to determine whether the process followed in arriving at the decision under review achieved the level of fairness required by the circumstances of the matter: Bataa v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 401 at para 3. [19] There was also agreement that the legal issue raised with respect to a determination of membership in an organization engaged in subversion pursuant to section 34 of the IRPA is a question of mixed fact and law and that the appropriate standard of review is reasonableness: El Werfalli v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 FC 612 at para 39. Reasonableness presumes deference to administrative tribunal decision-making. As long as the decision falls within a range of acceptable outcomes, which are defensible in respect of the facts and law, this Court need not intervene. [20] After hearing the submissions of counsel for the parties, the matter was taken under reserve. In light of the intervening decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] and Bell Canada v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66, and the Court\u2019s admonition at paragraph 144 in Vavilov, the parties were directed to advise whether they wished to make additional submissions on the appropriate standard of review or the application of that standard. By letter dated December 23, 2019, counsel for the Minister wrote that neither party intended to make additional submissions. [21] The majority of the Court in Vavilov articulated a new approach to determining the applicable standard of review, holding that administrative decisions should presumptively be reviewed on the reasonableness standard, unless either legislative intent or the rule of law requires otherwise. I am satisfied that neither of these two exceptions apply in the present case. [22] At paragraph 99 in Vavilov, the Court instructs that when reviewing the merits of an administrative decision, the judge must determine, \u201cwhether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2013 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2013 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d, clarifying the continued relevance of the existing jurisprudence. [23] The approach to be taken regarding an alleged breach of procedural fairness has not changed. It remains flexible and variable and depends on an appreciation of the context of the particular statute and the rights affected: Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817. The purpose of the participatory rights contained within it is to ensure that administrative decisions are made using a fair and open procedure, appropriate to the decision being made and its statutory, institutional and social context, with an opportunity for those affected to put forward their views and evidence fully and have them considered by the decision-maker. V. Analysis A. Whether the IAD breached procedural fairness [24] The Applicant submits that he was denied procedural fairness when the IAD member rejected his credibility. The Applicant claims that the IAD made a negative credibility finding against him despite the fact that he did not testify at his admissibility hearing and there is no further record of any statement from him regarding his participation in the demobilization program on this \ufb01le, other than his answers to questions from the CBSA Officer. [25] The Applicant submits there was an obvious need for him to testify orally at the hearing, as the IAD rejected his credibility without providing him any opportunity to defend himself and address the IAD\u2019s credibility concerns. According to the Applicant, this is contrary to the principle expressed by Madam Justice Eleanor Dawson in Ayele v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 126, at paragraph 11 where she held: [\u2026] one can never rule on the credibility of evidence that has not yet been heard. The presiding member violated this principle when he stated that even if the witness corroborated Mr. Ayele\u2019s testimony that subsequent testimony would not be credible. [26] The Applicant submits that fairness dictates that an opportunity should be provided to give oral testimony when an appellant\u2019s credibility is being challenged. He argues that the IAD was required to hold a hearing in light of subsection 25(1) of the Immigration Appeal Division Rules, SOR/2002-230 [the IAD Rules] which provides as follows: Proceeding in writing Proc\u00e9dures sur pi\u00e8ces 25 (1) Instead of holding a hearing, the Division may require the parties to proceed in writing if this would not be unfair to any party and there is no need for the oral testimony of a witness. 25 (1) La Section peut, au lieu de tenir une audience, exiger que les parties proc\u00e8dent par \u00e9crit, \u00e0 condition que cette fa\u00e7on de faire ne cause pas d\u2019injustice et qu\u2019il ne soit pas n\u00e9cessaire d\u2019entendre des t\u00e9moins. [27] This argument is without merit. [28] The scope of the IAD\u2019s jurisdiction is not limited to that of an appellate court. Appeals pursuant to subsection 63(5) of the IRPA are on a de novo basis and no deference to the ID decision is required. Subsection 25(1) of the IAD Rules gives the IAD the ability to proceed by way of a written proceeding. As master of its own procedure, the IAD is afforded significant deference in determining when to hold an oral hearing. [29] Paragraph 34(1)(f) of the IRPA provides that a foreign national is inadmissible on security grounds for \u201cbeing a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in acts referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (b,1.) or (c).\u201d Section 33 states that the facts that constitute inadmissibility for the purposes of section 34 \u201c. . . include facts for which there are reasonable grounds to believe that they have occurred, are occurring or may occur.\u201d The standard of \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d is less than a balance of probabilities but more than mere suspicion and must be based on compelling and credible evidence. [30] The credibility of the Applicant was at the heart of the ID's decision that the Minister failed to prove his case. Moreover, the weight to be given the Applicant\u2019s evidence was a central issue raised in the Minister\u2019s appeal to the IAD. [31] At a pre-hearing teleconference before the IAD member, the Applicant was represented by counsel. There is no indication that the IAD ever exercised its discretion \u201cto require to the parties to proceed in writing.\u201d To the contrary, it appears that counsel for the Applicant made an informed and calculated decision not to call any witnesses for the purpose of the appeal. It lies ill in the Applicant\u2019s mouth to now seek to take issue with the very procedure he agreed to because the result is not to his liking. [32] The Applicant was fully aware that the Minister was concerned about his membership in FARC, and he had a full opportunity to provide documentary evidence and submissions in response. [33] The Minister argued in his written submissions to the IAD that the Applicant did not provide any evidence that confirms his statements that he was not a real FARC member and that its was unreasonable to accept the statements. The Minister submitted that the Applicant had admitted to his membership in FARC to the Colombian authorities and to having received government benefits as a demobilized member. The Minister further argued that there was evidence to further support the Applicant\u2019s membership in FARC and that the information from Colombian authorities should weigh more than the statements made by the Applicant. The Applicant responded that the fact that he accepted benefits as a fake demobilized FARC member did not undermine his credibility. He argued that he did not intend to get involved with a fake FARC demobilization, but rather thought he was going to get a job at the mill. He submitted that after being falsely demobilized, he accepted the benefits because his economic circumstances were difficult. [34] The IAD cannot be criticized for conducting an independent assessment of the evidence on the record without giving the Applicant an opportunity to explain himself given that the Applicant's credibility was raised by the Applicant himself on appeal. [35] In the circumstances, the Applicant has not persuaded me that the decision to proceed in writing was unfair, nor am I convinced there was a need for any witnesses to testify orally. B. Whether the IAD\u2019s analysis of the evidence was reasonable [36] The Applicant did not dispute that FARC is an organization involved in subversion or terrorism as described in section 34 of the IRPA. Therefore, the IAD was only required to determine whether there were reasonable grounds to believe the Applicant was a member of FARC. [37] In Karakachian v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 948 at paragraph 32, Mr. Justice Yves de Montigny stated the standard of proof that corresponds to the existence of \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d requires more than mere suspicion but less than the civil standard of balance of probabilities. He stated reasonable grounds exist where there is an objective basis for the belief which is based on compelling and credible information. [38] There is no definition of the term \u201cmember\u201d in the IRPA. The term \u201cmember\u201d has been given an \u201cunrestricted and broad interpretation\u201d, as these provisions deal with security, subversion and terrorism, which are among the most serious concerns of government: Poshteh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FCA 85 at paras 26-32; Ismeal v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2010 FC 198 at para 20 [Ismeal]). [39] Neither proof of formal membership nor personal participation in specific acts of the organization are required to establish inadmissibility under paragraph 34(1)(f): Ismeal at paras 19-20. Instead, in Kanagendren v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FCA 86 at paragraph 22, the Federal Court of Appeal accepted: [\u2026] nothing in paragraph 34(1)(f) requires or contemplates a complicity analysis in the context of membership. Nor does the text of this provision require a \u201cmember\u201d to be a \u201ctrue\u201d member who contributed significantly to the wrongful actions of the group. These concepts cannot be read into the language used by Parliament. [40] Following a review of the record, I am satisfied that the IAD\u2019s Decision is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and it is justified in relation to the facts and law. The IAD applied a broad definition of \u201cmember\u201d to its analysis and assessment of the facts based on jurisprudence of this Court and the Federal Court of Appeal. [41] The IAD took into account the statutory declarations provided by the Applicant from his former employer, his former co-worker, and his ex-spouse. The Applicant does not dispute that the declarations were considered. He submits, however, that the reasons for placing little weight on this sworn evidence were unintelligible or not supported by the evidence. I disagree. [42] The IAD member discounted the former employer\u2019s declaration as he did not appear to have any knowledge of the Applicant\u2019s declaration as a demobilized FARC member. She afforded little weight to the ex-spouse\u2019s statement because the spouse only began her relationship with the Applicant at the time he became a demobilized FARC member. The reasons provided by the IAD, although brief, are sufficient to understand why the IAD placed more weight on the documentary evidence related to the Applicant\u2019s membership in FARC. [43] The IAD noted that the Applicant did not declare he was a member of the FARC or that he has previously declared he was a demobilized FARC member when he entered Canada and filed his refugee claim. The IAD found that the Applicant did not provide a satisfactory explanation for not doing so. This finding is well supported by the evidence and is unassailable. [44] The IAD member basically accepted the Applicant\u2019s story, including his evidence that he participated in the demobilization process, registered his name as a FARC member, and obtained an allowance payment as a FARC member. The member accepted that the Applicant likely suffered many injustices over the years and some of his participation with the FARC may have been under duress or coercion. She considered the Applicant\u2019s actions, whether taken under pretence or otherwise. [45] In my view, the IAD could reasonably find on the evidence before it that the Applicant was not under any duress when he registered his name as a FARC member and that he willingly participated in the FARC demobilization. The Applicant\u2019s motivation for participating in the alleged charade does not detract from the fact that there were reasonable grounds to believe that he was a member of FARC. VI. Conclusion [46] For the above reasons, I see no reviewable error in the IAD\u2019s determination that the Applicant is inadmissible to Canada. The application for judicial review is accordingly dismissed. [47] There are no questions for certification. JUDGMENT in IMM-4056-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that the application for judicial review is dismissed. \u201cRoger Lafreni\u00e8re\u201d Judge FEDERAL COURT SOLICITORS OF RECORD DOCKET: IMM-4056-19 STYLE OF CAUSE: LUIS FELIPE GARCES CACERES v THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS PLACE OF HEARING: VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA DATE OF HEARING: DECEMBER 18, 2019 JUDGMENT AND REASONS: LAFRENI\u00c8RE J.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200110 Docket: IMM-4222-18 Citation: 2020 FC 26 Ottawa, Ontario, January 10, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Madam Justice Elliott BETWEEN: DEJAN TRBOLJEVAC Applicant And THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] This is an application for judicial review of a decision made on August 2, 2018 by the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board [IRB] that determined the Applicant was not a Convention Refugee and not a person in need of protection [the Decision]. The Applicant seeks to set aside the Decision and have the matter referred to a different panel member for a new hearing. [2] The Applicant does not challenge the merits of the Decision. Rather, he challenges the procedural fairness of the process that resulted in his hearing date not being rescheduled as he had requested. Specifically, he says that he was denied natural justice by each of three procedural decisions. Two of those decisions were made before his hearing began and the third was made at the start of the hearing. [3] The first such procedural decision denied his request to reschedule the time and date of the hearing. The second procedural decision, made immediately prior to the start of the RPD hearing, confirmed the first decision. The third procedural decision was the refusal by the RPD Panel Member to accept documents which the Applicant tried to submit at the hearing in support of his claim. [4] For the reasons that follow, this application is allowed. II. Background Facts A. The Protection Claim [5] The Applicant is a citizen of Serbia who was resident in Kosovo. He arrived in Canada on January 24, 2012 and made a refugee claim in Hamilton, Ontario on January 30, 2012 on the basis of fear of assault by unknown Albanians and incarceration by the Serbian government. His Personal Information Form was received by the IRB on February 24, 2012. [6] Over six years later, on June 27, 2018, the Applicant was sent a Notice to Appear for a hearing to be held on July 27, 2018. [7] It is undisputed that the Notice to Appear was not received by the Applicant until July 14, 2018 as it was sent to an incorrect address. B. Notice of Intent to bring an Oral Motion [8] On July 24, 2018, the Applicant\u2019s former counsel wrote to the IRB on behalf of the Applicant. He advised that the Applicant intended to \u201cbring a formal, oral motion at the time of the commencement of the scheduled hearing\u201d to request the hearing date be rescheduled \u201cto a date and time several weeks into the future, in early to mid September or so, as agreeable to the parties involved\u201d. [9] The stated purposes for the request to reschedule were to permit the Applicant to prepare more effectively and appropriately, to obtain translations of various documents said to be significant with respect to the basis of claim, to review and consider new, more recent country condition documents, and to request the presence of witnesses both in person and by teleconference. [10] The reason provided for the lateness of the rescheduling request was that it was not reasonably possible for the Applicant to make arrangements to prepare for the hearing given the short time period between receipt of the notice on July 14, 2018 and the scheduled hearing date of July 27, 2018. [11] The request noted that it was not possible, due to this short period of time, to submit a formal written motion prior to the July 27, 2018 hearing. The request reiterated that it was the intention of the Applicant to make a formal, oral motion before the presiding member at the commencement of the July 27 scheduled hearing. [12] On July 25, 2018, the day after the request to reschedule was sent to the IRB, a Notice of Decision on Application to Change Date and Time of the hearing together with the Decision and Reasons was faxed to the former counsel. The Decision dismissed the application to change the date of the hearing. C. The RPD Hearing (1) The Coordinating Member [13] The RPD hearing was held on July 27, 2018. The Applicant and his former counsel both attended. Before the formal hearing began, a Coordinating Member considered the oral motion of former counsel for the Applicant requesting the adjournment. [14] The Coordinating Member refused the adjournment. They stated that they had reviewed and agreed with the decision made on July 25, 2018 to refuse the application of July 24, 2018 for an adjournment. Shortly thereafter, former counsel left the hearing and the Applicant continued alone. [15] The Coordinating Member subsequently addressed the Applicant directly. They pointed out that on March 21, 2018 the Applicant had received and signed a form saying that he was ready to proceed. The Applicant confirmed that fact. [16] The Coordinating Member then stated to the Applicant that he had known since March 18, 2018 that his hearing was going to happen \u201cat any time\u201d; that was his opportunity to prepare documents and make his arrangements to proceed. The Coordinating Member also stated that the rules are very clear and a request has to be made ten days prior to the hearing date but the request was made on the 24th (of July), three days before the hearing. [17] The Applicant stated that he agreed entirely with what the Coordinating Member said, except that the letter was received on July 24, 2018 and not the 20th (of June). [18] After the Coordinating Member acknowledged the delivery error by the IRB, the Applicant said that he was ready for the hearing and he respected the decision of the Board. When told that he had to be prepared because he had known since March 18, 2018 that \u201cit was going to happen\u201d, the Applicant replied and that \u201c[e]verything this file (sic) except for the fact of some documents arrived later documents from my ex-wife from Serbia who has taken me to court\u201d. [19] Shortly after that exchange, the Coordinating Member left the hearing room and the Panel Member entered to begin the hearing on the merits. (2) The Panel Member [20] After some formalities identifying the date and nature of the hearing, as well as confirming the language of interpretation, the Panel Member began by saying that they had reviewed the documents. The transcript indicates that the Applicant immediately said \u201cI have lots of documents that will prove my claim.\u201d [21] Moments later, after the Applicant began to explain when he came to Canada and who he feared, the Panel Member asked the Applicant if he had reported his assault to the police. The Applicant indicated that he had done so, and he had a police report and a medical report. The Panel Member said they could not accept the evidence as it had to be submitted 10 days in advance and \u201cit is against the rule to accept here in (sic).\u201d The Applicant then provided oral evidence as to the events, including his injuries. [22] In terms of his fears, the Applicant stated that he feared the Serbian government because his ex-wife was suing him and she had told the government that he had made a refugee claim in Canada. As a result, his father had twice received an envelope requiring him to go to Court to explain why the Applicant had sought refugee status in Canada. [23] The Applicant testified that he had proof for everything he had said, and that he was sorry it had not been submitted earlier. He ended by adding that he had reported to the CBSA every month for the past three and one-half years. [24] On August 7, 2018, the RPD sent a Notice of Decision to the Applicant denying his claim for protection. As already stated, this decision is not challenged on the merits, but the Applicant seeks to set it aside because of breaches of the duty of procedural fairness that violated his right to natural justice. III. Issue and Standard of Review [25] The Applicant alleges that the RPD failed in its duty to provide him with a procedurally fair hearing and, as a result, the Decision must be set aside. [26] When there is an issue of procedural fairness, the Court\u2019s task is to determine whether the process followed by the decision-maker satisfied the level of fairness required in all of the circumstances: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para 43 and Federal Courts Act, RSC 1985, c F-7 at para 18.1(4)(b). [27] The Federal Court of Appeal has recently further clarified that there is no standard of review for issues of procedural fairness. What is fair in any particular circumstance is highly variable and contextual. In assessing whether a process has been fair, no deference is given to the decision-making tribunal other than with respect to the choice of procedure. A reviewing Court uses the term \u201ccorrectness\u201d not as a standard of review but rather as the measure to determine whether the requirement to provide procedural fairness has been met. The reviewing court must be satisfied that the right to procedural fairness has been met: Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 [CPR] at paras 40 and 49. [28] Procedural fairness review involves asking whether a fair and just process was followed having regard to all the circumstances, including the nature of the substantive rights involved and the consequences for an individual: CPR at 53 - 54; Mission Institution v Khela, 2014 SCC 24 at para 79. IV. Analysis [29] This matter was heard before the Supreme Court of Canada released the decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov]. I have reviewed Vavilov and note that it does not alter the existing approach to determining whether an applicant\u2019s procedural fairness rights have been met. As procedural fairness is the determinative issue in this case, it was not necessary to request further submissions from the parties in light of Vavilov. A. Submissions of the parties [30] The Applicant submits that failure to grant a reasonable request for an adjournment is a breach of the duty of procedural fairness. It also violates the provisions of subsection 170(e) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] which states that the RPD, in any proceeding before it, \u201cmust give the person and the Minister a reasonable opportunity to present evidence, question witnesses and make representations.\u201d [31] To show that the hearing was procedurally unfair to him, the Applicant relies on Siloch v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), (1993) 151 NR 76 (FCA) [Siloch], where the Federal Court of Appeal set out a number of factors to be taken into account by adjudicators in exercising their discretion when considering a request to grant an adjournment. [32] The Respondent notes that Siloch is a 1993 case. As the IRPA was amended in 2012, the new Refugee Protection Division Rules, SOR/2012-256 [Rules] superseded Siloch. Nonetheless, from December 15, 2012, when revisions to the IRPA came into effect, to the date of this hearing, Siloch has been considered six times by this Court in immigration matters. [33] Rule 54 provides the process an applicant is to follow to seek an adjournment; it also sets out the factors to be considered by the RPD when such an application is received. The Respondent relies on the fact that the Applicant did not comply with Rule 54 despite being aware since March 2018 that his hearing would be scheduled and despite having signed the Intention to Proceed form. [34] For the reasons that follow, I find that by not accepting the documents which the Applicant attempted to tender at the opening of the hearing, the RPD deprived him of his right to be heard and to address the case against him. [35] As a result of the foregoing, it is unnecessary to consider whether the Siloch factors apply or whether the Applicant complied with, or was required to comply with, the provisions of Rule 54. I also note that the Applicant received the Notice to Appear outside the time required by Rule 25 but find it unnecessary to determine the consequence of that fact. B. The Hearing was Procedurally Unfair [36] There is no doubt that procedural fairness is an overarching requirement of hearings at the IRB. Subsection 162(2) of the IRPA requires the RPD to deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit. [37] This Court\u2019s jurisprudence has established that while there is no absolute right to counsel, there is a right to a fair hearing, particularly for those who are unrepresented: Aiyathurai v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1278 at para 9 and cases cited therein. [38] The actual hearing was quite brief. The transcript of the hearing itself is only three and one-half pages in length. The Member recognizes the Applicant is unrepresented then confirms the interpreter\u2019s language is Serbian. The Applicant then indicated that he had a lot of documents to prove his claim. [39] After asking the Applicant when he arrived in Canada, why he came to Canada, who beat him and when they beat him, the Panel Member asked the Applicant if he had reported the incident to the police. At that point, the Applicant said \u201c[y]es, I communicated this to the police I have report that (sic) and a medical report also.\u201d The Applicant indicated he had three copies of all the documents. [40] Rather than accept the documents, the Panel Member said it was \u201cagainst the rules\u201d to accept them at the hearing. The Member indicated that no documents would be accepted that day as they had to be submitted 10 days in advance. [41] The balance of the hearing involved a discussion of a beating and knife attack on the Applicant by unknown Albanians that resulted in the Applicant sustaining various cuts from the knife leaving scars on his back and face, as well as his teeth being broken. [42] The Applicant also discussed his fear of the Serbian government and the fact that he had previously been sent back to Kosovo from Serbia after six months. The Applicant said he had proof of that and of everything he told the Panel Member. [43] According to the transcript, at no point did the Panel Member question the Applicant as to the nature of the documents he brought to the hearing or ask to see them. Even when the documents were said to be directly responsive to questions put to the Applicant by the panel there is no indication that the Member was prepared to consider the documents. [44] The Applicant also tried to tender his documents after the hearing concluded, but they were returned as the Decision had already been rendered. [45] I have several concerns that lead me to conclude the hearing was not procedurally fair to the Applicant. First and foremost, he was self-represented. As previously indicated, the jurisprudence of this Court indicates that being self-represented carries with it the right to a fair hearing. [46] The Panel Member, based on the language used at the hearing, appears to have believed that they did not have the ability to accept any documents at the hearing. Subsections 170 (e), (g) and (h) of the IRPA however indicate that in any proceeding before the RPD it: (e) must give the person . . . a reasonable opportunity to present evidence . . .; (g) is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence; (h) may receive and base a decision on evidence that is adduced in the proceedings and considered credible or trustworthy in the circumstances. [47] While the Panel Member was aware of the ten-day time period in Rule 34(3) for disclosing documents, the failure of the Member to acknowledge or apparently be aware of the IRPA provisions allowing them to nonetheless accept the documents had the effect of preventing the Applicant from substantiating his claim. [48] The facts of this case are very similar to those found in Hasan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 1537. In Hasan, Mr. Justice Phelan set aside an IRB refugee decision and returned it for redetermination. He noted that the IRB exercised its discretion when it refused to admit relevant evidence at the hearing because it was outside the time period provided in the rules, but that it failed to consider the rule which gave it discretion to admit documents. [49] Mr. Justice Phelan found that the determination by the IRB not to admit the evidence significantly and adversely affected the ability of Mr. Hasan to prove his claim. He also noted that, if the evidence had been admitted, there was no offsetting prejudice to the Respondent. Mr. Justice Phelan concluded that the result was a denial of natural justice to Mr. Hasan as he was prevented from providing evidence to support his claim. [50] In the present matter, the failure of the Panel Member to admit the evidence that the Applicant both offered up and referred to several times prevented him from having a fair hearing. This being a claim for refugee protection, the potential consequences to the Applicant of the denial of his protection claim are very serious. After waiting six years to have his claim considered, fairness required that the evidence he wished to tender at his hearing be accepted, considered and addressed. [51] It is \u201cappropriate for a reviewing court to give weight to the manner in which an agency has sought to balance maximum participation on the one hand, and efficient and effective decision-making on the other\u201d: Re: Sound v Fitness Industry Council of Canada, 2014 FCA 48 at para 42. However, this respect for an agency\u2019s procedural choices coexists with an inquiry into whether the procedure followed by the decision-maker is fair in the circumstances of the case. [52] At a minimum, the Panel Member should have addressed why they declined to exercise the discretion provided to them in section 170 of the IRPA. Failure to exercise that discretion was a breach of natural justice in this matter. [53] The application is allowed and the Decision is set aside. The matter will be returned for redetermination by a differently constituted panel of the RPD. [54] Neither party suggested a serious question of general importance for certification nor do I find that one exists on these facts. JUDGMENT in IMM-4222-18 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The application is allowed and the Decision is set aside. The matter is returned for redetermination by differently constituted panel of the Refugee Protection Division. No serious question of general importance is certified. No costs are awarded. \"E.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200103 Docket: IMM-306-19 Citation: 2020 FC 8 Ottawa, Ontario, January 3, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice Norris BETWEEN: SELVIN SYLVESTER WILLIAMS Applicant and MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. OVERVIEW [1] The applicant was born in Jamaica in November 1987. In March 2001, when he was thirteen years of age, the applicant and his older sister landed in Canada as permanent residents after being sponsored by their father. [2] The applicant has had significant contact with the Canadian criminal justice system. Among the criminal offences he has committed are being an occupant in a motor vehicle in which he knew there was a firearm (a Beretta 9mm semi-automatic handgun which had one round of ammunition in the chamber) and unauthorized possession of a prohibited device (an over-capacity ammunition magazine clip for a Beretta 9mm semi-automatic handgun which contained five rounds of ammunition). These offences were committed in June 2012, when the applicant was twenty-four years of age. In September 2014, the applicant was sentenced to prison for two years less a day for each of these offences, to be served concurrently. The applicant was also placed on probation for one year. [3] These criminal convictions led to reports under section 44(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] that the applicant is inadmissible to Canada due to serious criminality under section 36(1)(a) of that Act. On December 13, 2017, a deportation order was issued against the applicant on the basis of the section 44(1) report relating to the conviction for unauthorized possession of a prohibited device. [4] In early 2018, the applicant applied for relief from his criminal inadmissibility and for the restoration of his permanent resident status on humanitarian and compassionate [H&C] grounds under section 25(1) of the IRPA. In the alternative, the applicant requested a temporary resident permit [TRP] under section 24(1) of the IRPA. He relied on the best interests of his two Canadian-born children, his establishment in Canada, his family ties to Canada, the hardship he would face in Jamaica, and the steps he had taken to rehabilitate himself and to distance himself from his previous criminality. [5] In a decision dated July 19, 2018, a Senior Immigration Officer denied the application. [6] The applicant now applies for judicial review of this decision under section 72(1) of the IRPA. He submits that the decision to reject his H&C application is unreasonable because the officer misapprehended the evidence concerning his criminal history, gave that factor unwarranted weight, and failed to give due consideration to the evidence of the applicant\u2019s rehabilitation. The applicant also submits that the decision to reject his request for a TRP is unreasonable because the officer erred when considering the applicant\u2019s long-term intention to remain in Canada. [7] For the reasons set out below, I have concluded that the applicant has failed to establish that the officer\u2019s decision on the H&C application is unreasonable. However, I agree with the applicant that the officer erred in refusing the request for a TRP. Accordingly, the application for judicial review will be allowed in part and the request for a TRP will be remitted for reconsideration by another decision maker. II. BACKGROUND [8] The applicant\u2019s adult criminal record appears to have begun in December 2008, when the applicant was convicted of assault and failure to comply with a probation order. (The fact that the applicant was subject to a probation order when he committed the assault entails that at some earlier time he had been found guilty of a criminal offence but there is otherwise no evidence in the record concerning this earlier offence.) The applicant received a suspended sentence and probation for two years on each offence, to be served concurrently. He was also prohibited under section 110 of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, from possessing any weapon, device, ammunition or explosive (as defined) for five years. Then, in January 2011, the applicant was convicted of failure to comply with a recognizance. (The fact that the applicant was subject to a bail order which he breached entails that at some earlier time he had been charged with another offence but there is otherwise no evidence in the record concerning this earlier charge or its disposition.) The applicant was sentenced to a fine of $400. [9] On June 29, 2012, the applicant was arrested and charged with a number of offences including assault with intent to resist arrest, escape lawful custody, unauthorized possession of a prohibited device (the over-capacity magazine clip for a Beretta 9mm semi-automatic handgun) and possession of a restricted weapon with ammunition (the Beretta 9mm semi-automatic handgun). Police officers had encountered the applicant and two other men at about 10:30 p.m. sitting in a parked car in the parking garage of a residential complex in Toronto. The applicant was in the back seat of the car, drinking a bottle of beer. Having noticed a strong odour of marijuana and seeing one of the other men in the car apparently attempting to hide something in the centre console between the front seats, the police ordered the three men out of the car and told them they were under arrest. As police officers attempted to handcuff the applicant, he pushed them and ran away. As he ran, the applicant threw away the Beretta magazine. After later searching the car, police found the Beretta handgun (with no magazine) under the front passenger seat but apparently accessible from the rear seat of the car. A quantity of marijuana was also found in the centre console. About an hour later, the applicant was located at a nearby apartment. He was arrested without further incident. [10] The applicant was initially detained in custody but he was eventually released on bail in September 2012. Following a judge alone trial in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice, in May 2014 the applicant was found guilty of escaping lawful custody contrary to section 145(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, unauthorized possession of a prohibited device contrary to section 91(3)(a) of the Criminal Code, and having been an occupant in a motor vehicle in which he knew that there was a firearm contrary to section 94(2)(a) of the Criminal Code. The applicant was acquitted of three charges relating to possession of the Beretta semi-automatic handgun. (The applicant entered guilty pleas to escaping lawful custody and unauthorized possession of a prohibited device at the commencement of his trial but pled not guilty to the other charges.) The trial judge\u2019s reasons for judgment are not included in the record on this application. [11] As noted, in September 2014 the applicant was sentenced to prison for two years less a day on the charges relating to the prohibited device and being in a motor vehicle knowing there was a firearm in it, to be served concurrently. The applicant was also sentenced to prison for three months for the escape lawful custody charge, to be served concurrently with the sentences on the other counts and placed on probation for one year. The trial judge\u2019s reasons for sentence are not included in the record on this application. [12] The applicant had dropped out of high school but he eventually obtained his Ontario Secondary School Diploma in 2013. In recent years he has been steadily and gainfully employed. He has been in a romantic relationship with K.S. since 2010. They have two children \u2013 a son born in 2012 and a daughter born in 2016. When the H&C/TRP application was submitted in early 2018, the applicant and K.S. were engaged to be married and had been living together since May 2015 (after the applicant was released on parole). While in custody, the applicant took part in a number of rehabilitative programs. Reports from the applicant\u2019s parole and probation officer were very positive. The applicant states that, since being released, he has been \u201cworking hard to resume a normal, law-abiding life,\u201d that he is \u201ccommitted to staying out of trouble, working hard and being a productive member of society.\u201d His focus had been on employment and his growing family. The applicant presented substantial evidence to corroborate these statements and there is no evidence in the record that casts doubt on any of them. The H&C/TRP application was also supported by comprehensive and detailed written submissions from counsel. III. DECISION UNDER REVIEW [13] Looking first at the application for H&C relief under section 25(1) of the IRPA, the officer considered the applicant\u2019s establishment in Canada, finding it to be a strong factor in his favour. The officer also considered the applicant\u2019s education and employment history, and his family ties to Canada, which included being engaged to his common-law spouse and the presence of his two children, his father, stepmother, two sisters, two aunts, and grandfather in Canada. All of these factors weighed in the applicant\u2019s favour. [14] The officer gave specific consideration to the best interests of the applicant\u2019s two young children. The officer noted that the children are emotionally and financially dependent on the applicant and that it would be challenging for their mother to raise them on a single income (or without two Canadian incomes). The officer concluded that it was in the children\u2019s best interests that the applicant remain in Canada and gave this factor \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d [15] The officer also considered the best interests of the applicant\u2019s half-sister, who is a minor. The officer found it to be in this child\u2019s best interests as well for the applicant to remain in Canada but attributed only some weight to this factor because no evidence was provided that she was dependent on the applicant. [16] The officer noted that the applicant had last visited Jamaica in 2003 and that there are adverse country conditions. The officer nevertheless found that the applicant would likely be able to establish himself in Jamaica given that he had lived there previously, spoke the language, still had family there and had transferrable skills. However, since the applicant would initially face \u201ca certain degree of hardship in the country,\u201d the officer gave this factor \u201csome weight in the application.\u201d [17] Finally, the officer considered the applicant\u2019s criminal history. The officer noted that the applicant\u2019s parole and probation officer described the applicant as \u201coutstanding\u201d and as someone who not only \u201cmet all parole and probation conditions but surpassed them.\u201d The immigration officer accepted that the applicant had changed his ways since he was charged in 2012. However, the officer also found that the applicant had demonstrated a \u201cmarked pattern of criminal behaviour,\u201d concluding that the applicant\u2019s criminal convictions were \u201ca serious and significant negative consideration.\u201d The officer found that, despite the positive changes the applicant had made in his life, the \u201csheer number of criminal offences\u201d ought to be given the \u201cutmost weight.\u201d [18] Weighing all of these considerations, the officer refused the application under section 25(1) of the IRPA. [19] Turning to the request for a TRP, the officer noted the applicant\u2019s \u201cneeds\u201d for being in Canada (family ties and establishment here) as well as his \u201crisks\u201d (the applicant\u2019s history of criminality). The officer found that the applicant intended to remain in Canada indeterminately, as evidenced by his application for permanent residence. The officer therefore concluded that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that his reasons for remaining in Canada were temporary and that he would leave by the end of the authorized period for his stay. As a result, the officer concluded that the issuance of a TRP was not justified. The officer also noted that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s criminality\u201d and \u201cfactors mitigating his risk in Canada,\u201d which had been considered previously in the H&C decision, had also been \u201cassessed in the context of a TRP application.\u201d The request for a TRP was therefore refused. IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW [20] The parties agree, as do I, that the officer\u2019s decision should be reviewed on the reasonableness standard. This is well-established with respect to H&C decisions (see Kanthasamy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, at para 44 [Kanthasamy]; Kisana v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FCA 189 at para 18 [Kisana]; Taylor v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 21 at para 16). That this is the appropriate standard has recently been reinforced by Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov], where the majority of the Court set out a revised framework for determining the standard of review with respect to the merits of an administrative decision (at para 10). Applying Vavilov, there is no basis for derogating from the presumption that reasonableness is the applicable standard of review of the officer\u2019s decision. [21] The majority in Vavilov also sought to clarify the proper application of the reasonableness standard (at para 143). The principles the majority emphasizes were drawn in large measure from prior jurisprudence, including Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, 2008 SCC 9, and its progeny. Even though the present application was argued prior to the release of Vavilov, the footing upon which the parties advanced their respective positions concerning the reasonableness of the officer\u2019s decision is consistent with these principles. [22] Reasonableness review \u201caims to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent to leave certain decisions with an administrative body while fulfilling the constitutional role of judicial review to ensure that exercises of state power are subject to the rule of law\u201d (Vavilov at para 82). The exercise of public power \u201cmust be justified, intelligible and transparent, not in the abstract but to the individuals subject to it\u201d (Vavilov at para 95). For this reason, an administrative decision maker has a responsibility \u201cto justify to the affected party, in a manner that is transparent and intelligible, the basis on which it arrived at a particular conclusion\u201d (Vavilov at para 96). Accordingly, on judicial review the court focuses on \u201cthe decision actually made by the decision maker, including both the decision maker\u2019s reasoning and the outcome\u201d (Vavilov at para 83). A reviewing court \u201cmust develop an understanding of the decision maker\u2019s reasoning process in order to determine whether the decision as a whole is reasonable\u201d (Vavilov at para 99). [23] A reasonable decision \u201cis one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d (Vavilov at para 85). Where the decision maker has provided reasons, the reviewing court must begin its inquiry into the reasonableness of the decision \u201cby examining the reasons provided with respectful attention and seeking to understand the reasoning process followed by the decision maker to arrive at its conclusion\u201d (Vavilov at para 84, internal quotation marks deleted). The reasons must be read in light of the record as a whole and with due sensitivity to the administrative setting in which they were given (Vavilov at paras 91-94). Unless the decision is unreasonable, the reviewing court must defer to the administrative decision maker\u2019s determination. [24] Before a decision can be set aside on the basis that it is unreasonable, the reviewing court must be satisfied that \u201cthere are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency\u201d (Vavilov at para 100). A court applying the reasonableness standard \u201cdoes not ask what decision it would have made in place of that of the administrative decision maker, attempt to ascertain the \u2018range\u2019 of possible conclusions that would have been open to the decision maker, conduct a de novo analysis or seek to determine the \u2018correct\u2019 solution to the problem\u201d (Vavilov at para 83). Absent exceptional circumstances, the reviewing court will not interfere with the administrative decision maker\u2019s factual findings (Vavilov at para 125). V. ISSUES [25] The applicant challenges the officer\u2019s decision on two main grounds: a) The decision to deny the H&C application is unreasonable; and b) The decision to deny the TRP request is unreasonable. VI. ANALYSIS A. The Legal Frameworks [26] In Vavilov, the majority emphasized the importance of the legal constraints that bear on administrative decision-making, including the statutory scheme within which the decision is made, when assessing the reasonableness of those decisions (Vavilov at paras 106 and 108). Three statutory provisions figure here: (1) section 36(1)(a) of the IRPA, which provides that a permanent resident or foreign national is inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality; (2) section 25(1) of the IRPA, which (among other things) can permit relief from inadmissibility on grounds of serious criminality on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; and (3) section 24(1) of the IRPA, which permits an officer to issue a temporary resident permit to someone despite that person\u2019s inadmissibility if the officer \u201cis of the opinion that it is justified in the circumstances.\u201d (See the Annex to these reasons for the relevant statutory provisions.) (1) Section 36(1)(a) of the IRPA [27] As has been noted many times, section 36(1)(a) of the IRPA reflects a form of social contract. In exchange for the opportunity to reside in Canada, permanent residents (and foreign nationals) are expected not to commit serious criminal offences. The IRPA recognizes that immigration brings many benefits to Canada and that the \u201csuccessful integration of permanent residents involves mutual obligations for those new immigrants and for Canadian society,\u201d including the obligation of the former to avoid serious criminality (Tran v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 SCC 50, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 289 at paras 1-2 [Tran]). The IRPA \u201caims to permit Canada to obtain the benefits of immigration, while recognizing the need for security and outlining the obligations of permanent residents\u201d (Tran at para 40). Notably, Parliament has stated that among the objectives of the IRPA with respect to immigration are \u201cto protect public health and safety and to maintain the security of Canadian society\u201d and \u201cto promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights and by denying access to Canadian territory to persons who are criminals or security risks\u201d (IRPA paragraphs 3(1)(h) and (i)). [28] As the Supreme Court of Canada observed in Medovarski v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration); Esteban v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2005] 2 S.C.R. 539, 2005 SCC 51, the objectives of the IRPA \u201cindicate an intent to prioritize security. This objective is given effect by preventing the entry of applicants with criminal records, by removing applicants with such records from Canada, and by emphasizing the obligation of permanent residents to behave lawfully while in Canada\u201d (at para 10). As a result, when a permanent resident commits a serious criminal offence (as defined), this breach of the social contract can lead not only to the consequences imposed by the criminal courts but also to the loss of his or her immigration status and removal from Canada. [29] The obligation to avoid serious criminality lest adverse immigration consequences follow applies equally to all permanent residents (and foreign nationals). That being said, the uniform application of this principle to all cases can lead to injustice or unfairness in some. Section 25(1) of the IRPA exists to protect against this result. (2) Section 25(1) of the IRPA [30] This provision authorizes the Minister to grant relief to a foreign national seeking permanent resident status who is inadmissible or otherwise does not meet the requirements of the Act. The Minister may grant the foreign national permanent resident status or an exemption from any applicable criteria or obligations under the Act. Relief of this nature will only be granted if the Minister \u201cis of the opinion that it is justified by humanitarian and compassionate considerations relating to the foreign national.\u201d These considerations include matters such as children\u2019s rights, needs and best interests; maintaining connections between family members; and averting the hardship a person would suffer on being sent to a place where he or she has no connections (Agraira v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36, [2013] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para 41). The fundamental question is whether an exception ought to be made in a given case to the usual operation of the law (see Damian v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1158 at paras 16-22). [31] In Kanthasamy, the Supreme Court of Canada endorsed an approach to section 25(1) that is grounded in its equitable underlying purpose. Writing for the majority, Justice Abella approved of the approach taken in Chirwa v Canada (Minister of Manpower & Immigration) (1970), 4 IAC 338, where it was held that H&C considerations refer to \u201cthose facts, established by the evidence, which would excite in a reasonable [person] in a civilized community a desire to relieve the misfortunes of another \u2013 so long as these misfortunes \u2018warrant the granting of special relief\u2019 from the effect of the provisions of the Immigration Act\u201d (Kanthasamy at para 13). This discretion provides flexibility to mitigate the effects of a rigid application of the law in appropriate cases (Kanthasamy at para 19). Section 25(1) should therefore be interpreted to allow it \u201cto respond flexibly to the equitable goals of the provision\u201d (Kanthasamy at para 33). [32] There will inevitably be some hardship associated with being required to leave Canada and \u201c[t]his alone will not generally be sufficient to warrant relief on humanitarian and compassionate grounds under s. 25(1)\u201d (Kanthasamy at para 23). What does warrant relief will vary depending on the facts and context of the case (Kanthasamy at para 25). H&C relief is an exceptional and highly discretionary measure (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Legault, 2002 FCA 125 at para 15; Williams v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1303 at para 4). The onus is on an applicant to present sufficient evidence to warrant the exercise of such discretion in his or her case (Kisana at para 45; Owusu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FCA 38 at para 5; Ahmad v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 646 at para 31; Zlotosz v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2017 FC 724 at para 22). [33] Section 25(1) also expressly requires a decision maker to take into account the best interests of a child directly affected by a decision made under that provision. Protecting children through the application of this principle means \u201c[d]eciding what . . . appears most likely in the circumstances to be conducive to the kind of environment in which a particular child has the best opportunity for receiving the needed care and attention\u201d (Kanthasamy at para 36, quoting MacGyver v Richards (1995), 22 OR (3d) 481 (CA), at p 489). [34] In summary, an H&C application is a weighing exercise in which an immigration officer is asked to consider different and sometimes competing factors. When, as in the present case, an H&C exemption from criminal inadmissibility is sought, the officer must weigh the public policy reflected in section 36(1) of the IRPA against the individual circumstances of the case and determine whether the latter outweigh the former so as to warrant making an exception to the usual rule that serious criminality by a permanent resident leads to loss of status and removal from Canada. The officer\u2019s determination is entitled to deference from a reviewing court unless the applicant can establish that it is unreasonable. (3) Section 24(1) of the IRPA [35] This provision provides for the issuance of a temporary resident permit to someone who is inadmissible or who does not meet the requirements of the Act \u201cif an officer is of the opinion that it is justified in the circumstances.\u201d Such a permit may be cancelled at any time. Further, under section 63 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227, a temporary resident permit is valid until one of the following events occurs: (a) the permit is cancelled under section 24(1) of the Act; (b) the permit holder leaves Canada without obtaining prior authorization to re-enter Canada; (c) the period of validity specified on the permit expires; or (d) a period of three years elapses from the date of validity. [36] Operational instructions and guidelines from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada [IRCC] that were in effect at the time shed additional light on how decisions on applications for TRPs were made when the applicant submitted his request. (They have since been modified in some respects \u2013 for example, by clarifying that the predominant consideration is whether \u201cthe individual\u2019s purpose for entering Canada balances Canada\u2019s social, humanitarian and economic commitments to the health and security of Canadians, per the objectives of the IRPA\u201d: see https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/permits/eligibility-assessment.html.) While such instructions and guidelines are not law and are not binding, they can \u201coffer guidance on the background, purpose, meaning and reasonable interpretation of legislation\u201d (Mousa v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2016 FC 1358 at para 11). [37] The instructions and guidelines explain that the officer will determine whether \u201cthe need for the foreign national to enter or remain in Canada is compelling\u201d and whether \u201cthe need for the foreign national\u2019s presence in Canada outweighs any risk to Canadians or Canadian society.\u201d In evaluating \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d versus \u201crisks\u201d, officers \u201cmust consider the factors that make the person\u2019s presence in Canada necessary and the intent of the legislation to maintain program integrity and protect public health and safety.\u201d The officer must be satisfied that \u201cthe reasons or benefits for an individual to enter or remain in Canada outweigh the risks.\u201d [38] IRCC instructions and guidelines pertaining specifically to risk assessments in cases of criminal inadmissibility note that the \u201conus is on the client to demonstrate their level of risk and that further criminal activity is unlikely.\u201d In making this determination, officers are directed to assess, among other things: the seriousness of the offence the chances of committing further offences evidence of reform or rehabilitation if there is a pattern of criminal behaviour (e.g. the offence was a single event and out of character) if all sentences have been completed, fines paid or restitution made if there are any outstanding charges. See: https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/permits/considerations-specific-inadmissibility-on-criminality-grounds.html. [39] Finally, section 29(2) of the IRPA provides that a temporary resident \u201cmust comply with any conditions imposed under the regulations and with any requirements under this Act [and] must leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.\u201d B. The Officer\u2019s Determinations (1) The H&C Decision [40] As set out above, the officer found that a number of factors weighed in the applicant\u2019s favour. Indeed some, such as the best interests of the applicant\u2019s children, were given \u201cconsiderable weight.\u201d The applicant does not take issue with any of these determinations. On the other hand, the officer gave \u201cthe utmost weight\u201d to the applicant\u2019s criminality in assessing the request for H&C relief. In the end, the officer concluded that \u201cthe factors supporting an approval\u201d did not \u201coutweigh the applicant\u2019s significant criminal history.\u201d [41] Specifically, the officer found as a fact that the applicant had been convicted of ten criminal offences and each of these convictions was \u201ca serious and significant negative consideration of the application [sic] as it demonstrates [the applicant\u2019s] failure to comply with criminal law and the judicial system of Canada.\u201d The officer found as a fact that the applicant had been convicted of six failure to comply offences and these, together with the escape lawful custody conviction, \u201cfurther demonstrates [the applicant\u2019s] disregard of previously imposed conditions and of law enforcement officials in Canada.\u201d The officer also found as a fact that the applicant \u201chas convictions of possession (of a semi-automatic handgun and over-capacity magazine clip) which may have led to further violence and took place when [the applicant] was already subject to a weapons prohibition.\u201d [42] While not raised in the applicant\u2019s memorandum of argument, in oral argument counsel for the applicant suggested that the officer had misapprehended the evidence relating to his criminal record in material respects. Although I have concerns about the basis for some of the officer\u2019s findings of fact in relation to the applicant\u2019s criminal record, I am not persuaded that the officer\u2019s reliance on that record is unreasonable. [43] The officer found that the applicant had been convicted of ten criminal offences. This appears to consist of the following: assault in 2008, escape lawful custody in 2014, unauthorized possession of a prohibited device in 2014, possession of a semi-automatic handgun in 2014, and six counts of failure to comply. (For the sake of clarity, as set out above, the applicant was acquitted of three charges relating to possession of the semi-automatic handgun. However, he was convicted of an offence under section 94(1) of the Criminal Code for being an occupant of a motor vehicle in which he knew there was a restricted firearm. Reflecting a form of constructive possession, this offence is referred to in the Criminal Code as that of \u201cunauthorized possession in motor vehicle.\u201d) [44] There is no question that the applicant was convicted of four substantive offences. This leaves six convictions for failure to comply to make up the total of ten convictions. The problem is that the information and evidence on this application (in particular, the record kept by the Canadian Police Information Centre (commonly referred to as CPIC)) included in the Certified Tribunal Record appears to establish only two failure to comply convictions \u2013 failure to comply with probation in 2008 and failure to comply with a recognizance in 2011. Four alleged convictions for failure to comply offences remain unaccounted for. [45] This is obviously concerning. In other circumstances, it could well have vitiated the officer\u2019s decision. However, what is determinative in the present case is that the applicant has not offered any evidence that the officer is actually mistaken in concluding that he had been convicted of a total of six failure to comply offences. [46] The applicant knew the officer had made this finding of fact when he sought judicial review of the officer\u2019s decision. In his affidavit in support of this application, the applicant describes the circumstances that led to the 2008 assault conviction (although he does not explain why he was on probation at the time of the incident). He then says simply: \u201cApart from failure to comply convictions, my next interaction with the court system came in 2012.\u201d (The reference to 2012 is, of course, to the June 29, 2012, incident.) The applicant presumably knows what his criminal record is. His CPIC record reflects only one failure to comply conviction between the 2008 assault conviction and the 2012 incident yet the applicant refers to \u201cconvictions\u201d in the plural, without providing further details. If the applicant believed that the officer had erred in finding that his criminal record included a total of six convictions for failure to comply offences, one would expect him to have pointed out the mistake and not to have dealt with the issue so casually. [47] Further, on the basis of the information and evidence in the record on the H&C application, it was not unreasonable for the officer to make this finding of fact. The applicant would have known that the referral for an admissibility hearing in relation to his two reportable convictions prepared by the Canada Border Services Agency in 2016 listed his non-reportable convictions as \u201cassault\u201d and \u201cfailure to comply x 6.\u201d While the source of this information is far from clear, the applicant did not take issue with it in his affidavit in support of the H&C application. Instead, after describing the assault incident (again without explaining why he was on probation at the time), he said simply: \u201cApart from failure to comply convictions, my next interaction with the court system came in 2012.\u201d [48] The number of convictions for failure to comply offences was an important factor for the officer because they demonstrated a disregard for Canadian law and court-imposed obligations on the part of the applicant. The applicant has not persuaded me that the officer\u2019s reliance on this factor is unreasonable. [49] The applicant also contends that the officer failed to give due consideration to the evidence of his rehabilitation in weighing relevant factors under section 25(1) of the IRPA. I do not agree. [50] The officer expressly accepted that \u201cthe applicant has made changes to steer himself away from his previous lifestyle\u201d and commended the applicant for \u201ctaking various rehabilitative programs, maintaining full employment, and abstaining from smoking marijuana.\u201d The officer also acknowledged \u201cthe positive changes the applicant has undergone since his last convictions and lack of criminality since then.\u201d On the other hand, the officer noted that the applicant\u2019s criminal history did not reflect an isolated event; rather, the convictions spanned several years, which the officer found demonstrated \u201ca marked pattern of criminal behaviour.\u201d Residents of Canada are expected to obey the law. Considering the number of offences of which the applicant had been convicted and their nature (including serious firearms offences), the officer found that the evidence of rehabilitation did not outweigh these significant negative considerations. In challenging the officer\u2019s decision as he does, the applicant is in effect asking me to reweigh these unquestionably relevant factors. That is not my role. [51] Further, I do not accept the applicant\u2019s submission that, as in Sivalingam v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 1185 at para 9, the officer focused on why the applicant was inadmissible in such a way as to reinforce rather than mitigate the rigidity of the law. Given the seriousness of the applicant\u2019s criminal history, the officer\u2019s assessment of that factor amongst all the other relevant factors (including the evidence of the applicant\u2019s rehabilitation) was not unreasonable. [52] Having regard to the foregoing, the applicant has not persuaded me that the officer\u2019s exercise of discretion under section 25(1) of the IRPA is unreasonable. [53] I do, however, agree with the applicant that the officer erred in rejecting the request for a TRP. I turn to this now. (2) The TRP Decision [54] The applicant requested, in the alternative, that he be permitted to remain in Canada on a TRP if his request for H&C relief was refused. Counsel provided detailed submissions in support of this alternative request. These submissions tracked closely the IRCC instructions and guidelines reviewed above. Among other things, counsel relied on the best interests of the applicant\u2019s children and the applicant\u2019s establishment in Canada as demonstrating a compelling need for the applicant to remain in Canada. She also addressed in detail the issue of risk, discussing the nature of the applicant\u2019s offences and his steps towards rehabilitation within the framework outlined in paragraph 38, above. [55] In summary, counsel for the applicant submitted as follows to the officer: Given the above, the Applicant poses little risk to the Canadian public if permitted to remain in Canada on a TRP. It is noteworthy that TRPs may be cancelled at any time. As such, issuing a TRP to the Applicant would essentially provide the Applicant an opportunity to prove that he is fully rehabilitated and if he fails to do so, Immigration Refugee & Citizenship Canada [sic] may cancel the TRP and immediately enforce removal. [56] Although counsel did not state it expressly in her submissions to the officer, there is no issue that TRPs can and have been employed in effect as a form of probation to give someone who is criminally inadmissible to Canada but who has compelling reasons to remain here the chance to continue to build a track record of law-abiding behaviour: see, for example, Cardenas v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 263 at para 7. [57] In the decision, the officer \u201cnoted\u201d both the reasons the applicant relied on to demonstrate his compelling need to remain in Canada and the risk arising from the applicant\u2019s criminality. The officer \u201cnoted\u201d that the risks assessment for the TRP concerns the applicant\u2019s criminality, which has rendered him inadmissible to Canada. The officer \u201cnoted\u201d that the applicant had ten criminal convictions. The officer also \u201cnoted\u201d that \u201ccounsel states the applicant was released from incarceration in May 2015 and has complied with conditions of his parole and has no outstanding charges. Counsel further states,\u201d the officer continued, \u201cthe applicant poses little risk to the Canadian public\u201d. Despite having \u201cnoted\u201d all these things, the officer refused the request for a TRP on an entirely different ground: the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he would leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for his stay. [58] In its entirety, the officer\u2019s reasoning in support of this conclusion is as follows: I find the applicant has expressed a desire to remain in Canada for indeterminate [sic] period of time, which is also evident by him submitting an application for permanent residence. I further find the applicant\u2019s ties within Canada are considerably stronger than those of his country of citizenship, Jamaica. As a result, I find the applicant failed to demonstrate his reasons to remain in Canada, such as to be with his immediate family, would be temporary in duration and that he would leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for his stay. [59] The applicant submits that this determination is unreasonable. I agree. [60] Obviously, the applicant made no secret of his desire to stay in Canada permanently or the reasons why. But simply having a desire to stay in Canada permanently and having stronger ties to Canada than to one\u2019s country of citizenship does not entail that one would not leave Canada if and when required to do so. Whether a given individual would leave Canada if and when required to do so is a question of fact. Depending on the circumstances, a negative answer may require a fine-grained analysis of the evidence (notwithstanding that the burden rests on the applicant to establish this precondition to being given a TRP). That this is a separate and distinct question is reflected in section 22(2) of the IRPA, which specifically contemplates granting a foreign national temporary resident status even if the foreign national has an intention to become a permanent resident, as long as the officer is satisfied that the person will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay. [61] In the present case, given the interests at stake and the detailed submissions provided in support of the request, the officer\u2019s conclusory statement that the applicant had failed to demonstrate that he would leave Canada by the end of his authorized stay simply because he wants to stay here permanently and has stronger ties to Canada than to Jamaica falls well short of the requisite degree of justification, transparency and intelligibility. [62] Although this is sufficient to dispose of this aspect of the application for judicial review in the applicant\u2019s favour, I would also add this. As set out above, the officer \u201cnotes\u201d several facets of the risk analysis. To the extent that the officer made any findings of fact in this regard, they are simply adopted from the H&C analysis. The officer states: \u201cI also note I have considered the applicant\u2019s criminality in the H&C decision above, along with the factors mitigating his risk in Canada, and assessed it in the context of a TRP application. I note my assessment of the applicant\u2019s criminal history in Canada remains the same.\u201d [63] In my view, while it is indisputable that the applicant\u2019s criminal history in Canada is a relevant consideration in the request for a TRP, it was insufficient for the officer simply to adopt the earlier analysis of this factor in relation to the H&C application. [64] The discretion bestowed on an officer by sections 25(1) and 24(1) of the IRPA, respectively, are similar in that each allows for relief from a strict or rigid application of the law. However, section 24(1) is more narrowly framed. It does not embody the broad equitable discretion to make exceptions based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations that section 25(1) does. Rather, a TRP is a time-limited privilege available in specific circumstances. It is expressly provided for by Canadian immigration law and policy to permit flexibility when other aspects of that law and policy (e.g. the requirement that one not be inadmissible) would lead to an individual\u2019s exclusion from Canada (cf. Alabi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1163 at para 20). [65] When the applicant requested a TRP, he needed to establish that his reasons for remaining in Canada were sufficiently compelling to outweigh any risks posed by his continued presence here. This was the heart of the matter (cf. Shabdeen v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 303 at para 23). The officer simply adopted the earlier assessment of the applicant\u2019s criminal history from the analysis under section 25(1) but the assessment of the significance of the applicant\u2019s criminality is more constrained under section 24(1) than it is under section 25(1). This is so for at least three reasons. First, under section 24(1) of the IRPA, the significance of a criminal history is more closely tied to an assessment of risk as a forward-looking determination. This is reflected in the IRCC instructions and guidelines, which state that the onus is on an applicant \u201cto demonstrate their level of risk and that further criminal activity is unlikely\u201d (emphasis added). Second, the significance of the breach of the social contract entailed by committing criminal offences must be judged in relation to this forward-looking assessment rather than in relation to the broader equitable considerations that guide decisions under section 25(1) of the IRPA. Third, unlike a decision to grant someone permanent residence, the scope of the risk Canada would be assuming by granting a TRP under section 24(1) is constrained by the duration of the TRP (which, to repeat, is time-limited and can be cancelled at any time). [66] The applicant\u2019s \u201crisk\u201d given his criminal history and efforts at rehabilitation might or might not be overcome by his compelling reasons for wanting to remain in Canada. This was for the officer to determine. Given the distinct legal framework in which this determination had to be made when considering the request for a TRP, it was unreasonable for the officer simply to adopt the \u201cassessment of the applicant\u2019s criminal history in Canada\u201d from the H&C decision. Further analysis reflective of the legal framework for determining a request for a TRP under section 24(1) of the IRPA was required. VII. CONCLUSION [67] For these reasons, the application for judicial review is allowed in part. The decision refusing the applicant\u2019s request for a temporary resident permit under section 24(1) of the IRPA is set aside and the matter is remitted for redetermination by another decision maker in accordance with these reasons. [68] The parties did not suggest any serious questions of general importance for certification under section 74(d) of the IRPA. I agree that none arise. JUDGMENT IN IMM-306-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that The application for judicial review is allowed in part. The decision dated July 19, 2018, refusing the applicant\u2019s request for a temporary resident permit under section 24(1) of the IRPA is set aside and the matter is remitted for redetermination by another decision maker in accordance with these reasons. No question of general importance is stated. \u201cJohn Norris\u201d Judge ANNEX Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 Temporary resident R\u00e9sident temporaire 22 (1) [\u2026] 22 (1) [\u2026] Dual intent Double intention (2) An intention by a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not preclude them from becoming a temporary resident if the officer is satisfied that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.

{"doc_text": " RAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAR : MC005266 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision \u2013 Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW This is the appeal filed by Alain Vincent Bikey-Amougou, a Cameroonian citizen who fears living in his country because of his political opinion. He is claiming refugee protection under section 96 and subsection 97(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that he was not credible. On appeal before the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD), the appellant argues that his counsel before the RPD was disbarred from the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec [Quebec bar] and that he represented the appellant illegally and incompetently before the RPD. This illegal representation allegedly resulted in a breach of the principles of natural justice. The Minister did not intervene in this appeal. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND The RPD rejected Mr. Bikey-Amougou\u2019s refugee protection claim on November 26, 2019. The appellant instructed his counsel before the RPD to file an appeal before the RAD. Counsel did not file the appeal and did not notify the appellant of this. On December 9, 2020, the appellant was summoned by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). During that interview, he found out that the appeal had not been filed and that he would be removed from Canada. The appellant was detained until February 12, 2020. On February 28, he consulted a new counsel, who submitted an urgent application for an extension of time to file an appeal, along with an appeal, to the RAD Registry. Due to the tight time frame, the RAD did not receive this urgent application until March 3, two business days later. The appellant was deported to Cameroon on April 4, 2020. Owing to administrative errors and difficulties relating to the COVID19 pandemic, it was not until May 11, 2021, that the RAD ruled on and allowed the appellant\u2019s application for an extension of time filed on February 28, 2020, on the grounds that the appellant had reasonably explained the delay in filing his appeal, had acted diligently, and had established an arguable appeal alleging the incompetence of his counsel. The appeal was perfected on May 11, 2021. The appellant\u2019s counsel argues in his additional submissions dated July 15, 2021, that although the appellant was deported to Cameroon, the RAD should review his case as if he were in Canada. The RAD asked the Minister to provide submissions on the issue of jurisdiction, but the Minister did not intervene in this matter; therefore, there is no representation from the Minister. I also note that the Minister received notice of the appellant\u2019s application for an extension of time to file the appeal, as well as a notice stating that an oral hearing was to be held and outlining the credibility issues that gave rise to this hearing. The notice required by the Federal Court\u2019s decision in Alazar was not sent to the Minister\u2019s counsel in this case because, in my view, the issue is not new. In fact, the issue of the RAD\u2019s jurisdiction to decide Mr. Bikey-Amougou\u2019s appeal after he was removed to Cameroon was raised in his memoranda that were filed with the RAD. I note that the Minister was notified of the jurisdictional issue in Mr. Bikey-Amougou\u2019s case on November 6, 2020, and did not intervene. I. THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION HAS JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE APPEAL ANALYSIS OF JURISDICTION To begin, I will point out that one of the IRPA\u2019s objectives is to save lives. It should also be noted that the IRPA is silent on the issue of the RAD\u2019s jurisdiction to decide an appeal after the appellant has been deported and is no longer in Canada. The case law is not clear on this issue either. The appellant was removed from Canada and therefore left Canada involuntarily because his counsel failed to file a notice of appeal that would have statutorily stayed the enforcement of the removal order. Prior to his removal, the appellant filed an application for an extension of time to file an appeal, along with a notice of appeal. In the absence of legislative provisions or case law speaking to the issue, I examined, by analogy, the Federal Court\u2019s jurisprudence regarding the mootness of an application for judicial review when a claimant is no longer in Canada. Case law on the mootness of a proceeding Most of the case law pertaining to mootness in immigration matters deals with pre\u2011removal risk assessments (PRRAs). The case law can be distinguished from the appellant\u2019s case, in particular because a PRRA is intended to assess the risk of a removal itself, and a new PRRA following a removal will rarely have any tangible impact on the issue in dispute, unlike in the case of a refugee protection claimant who was unable to pursue his appeal rights. In fact, the Federal Court\u2019s case law makes a distinction between a person who is outside Canada and is claiming refugee protection, and a person who has already had their status determined but has been deported. In Freitas, the claimant had been deported and was outside Canada. The Federal Court concluded that the appeal was not moot in those circumstances. The Court\u2019s conclusion was partly based on Canada\u2019s international obligations, the IRPA\u2019s objectives, and the fact that the claimant had been deported to Venezuela, his country of nationality, following an incorrect decision rendered by the RPD (the CRDD at that time) regarding the claimant\u2019s exclusion under Article 1F of the Convention. In that case, the failed refugee protection claimant had been deported from Canada, but the Court concluded that deportation did not deprive him of his right to pursue both the judicial review and his claim for refugee protection once the Court set aside the RPD\u2019s determination. Like Mr. Bikey-Amougou, the appellant in Freitas had been involuntarily deported despite his intention to pursue his appeal. In Molnar, in 2015, the Federal Court confirmed the Court\u2019s approach in Freitas (decided under the old Act) and Rosa, while reiterating the importance of the IRPA\u2019s underlying objectives, including granting fair consideration to those fleeing persecution, offering a safe haven to persons who are able to demonstrate that they are Convention refugees, and establishing fair and efficient procedures that maintain the integrity of the Canadian refugee protection system, while upholding Canada\u2019s respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all human beings. I note, however, the Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s comments in Kreishan regarding the exceptional nature of Freitas. These cases were referenced again in Mrda (2016), which involved failed refugee protection claimants who had been deported to either Serbia or Croatia. In that case, the judge noted the appellants\u2019 continued interest in their judicial review following their deportation, contrary to the applicant in Harvan, in which the judge concluded that the issue had disappeared and that the case had become moot given the lack of any communication or participation on the part of the applicant following his removal, which, in itself, distinguishes Harvan from this appeal. Along the same lines, the Court also dismissed applications for judicial review filed by applicants who returned to their country voluntarily. Therefore, I draw the following conclusions from my review of the Federal Court\u2019s jurisprudence. The determination of refugee protection does not necessarily become moot once the appellants have been deported from Canada, whether or not they have been deported to their country of citizenship, when certain factors are in place. The following factors are determinative in the Federal Court\u2019s jurisprudence: A refugee protection claim was made in Canada. The departure was involuntary. The case is arguable. The person has taken steps to exercise their rights. The person\u2019s behaviour is consistent with the existence of an ongoing issue, even though they are no longer in Canada. Mr. Bikey-Amougou\u2019s appeal is not moot and the Refugee Appeal Division has jurisdiction to decide the appeal In the case at hand, the appellant\u2019s representative did not file an appeal with the RAD and did not inform the appellant of this. Therefore, the appellant found himself in a situation in which his time frame to file an appeal had expired and he did not benefit from the stay set out in the IRPA regarding the enforcement of a removal order that had become enforceable. Mr. Bikey-Amougou was involuntarily deported from Canada and his appeal is arguable. As soon as Mr. Bikey-Amougou realized that he had been represented illegally by someone who had presented himself as a lawyer and who had not filed a notice of appeal, he retained new counsel, sent an urgent letter to the RAD Registry prior to his removal, and diligently pursued his appeal before the RAD, despite the fact that he was now in Cameroon. I will therefore render a decision in this appeal as though the appellant were in Canada, as recommended in Freitas. I conclude that (I) the RAD has jurisdiction to hear the appeal despite the fact that the appellant is in Cameroon; (II) some of the evidence presented on appeal is admissible; (III) there are grounds to hold an oral hearing; (IV) there was a breach of the principles of natural justice and a breach of procedural fairness in light of the representation by an unauthorized representative who tainted the proceedings and the RPD\u2019s determination; and (V) based on the evidence and testimony provided during the hearing before the RAD, as well as the recent documentary evidence on Cameroon, the appellant has established that he is a refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA. In the following paragraphs, I will explain why I have reached these conclusions. The appeal is allowed. II. NEW EVIDENCE PRESENTED ON APPEAL Evidence presented by the appellant The RAD may allow new evidence (i) that arose after the rejection of the claim, (ii) that was not reasonably available before the RPD rendered its decision, or (iii) that the appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented at the time of the rejection. New evidence that meets at least one of these criteria must then comply with the three jurisprudential criteria of relevance, credibility and newness. The appellant filed new evidence and requested an oral hearing. He initially submitted new evidence with his memorandum (items 1 to 4), then submitted additional documents under rule 29 (items 5 to 22). The following new evidence was presented on appeal: Appellant\u2019s affidavit signed on March 2, 2020 Statement concerning the facts underlying his refugee protection claim, signed by the appellant on March 2, 2020 Appellant\u2019s complaint to the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec against Henri Jordan dated March 2, 2020 Amnesty International article dated February 21, 2019, and Human Rights Watch article dated March 7, 2019 With respect to these items, the memorandum fails to comply with subparagraph 3(3)(g)(iii), because it does not explain how the documentary evidence in question meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. Nonetheless, I have sufficient information in the record to address the admissibility of the new evidence without submissions, and I relieve the appellant of this procedural defect. The following new evidence was contained in the application filed under rule 29: An email from the appellant\u2019s counsel to Mr. Jordan dated October 13, 2021, informing him of the complaint filed with the Barreau An acknowledgment of receipt of the complaint from the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec, dated March 17, 2020 Subpoena from the Barreau du Qu\u00e9bec concerning Henri Jordan, dated March 30, 2021 Superior Court of Qu\u00e9bec decision dated June 4, 2019 in Hrang v. Barreau de Montr\u00e9al Court of Qu\u00e9bec decision in R v. Zhou Blog article (SOQUIJ) dated March 25, 2021, La pratique ill\u00e9gale du droit, un sujet qui demeure d\u2019actualit\u00e9 [the illegal practice of law, a topic that remains relevant] Letter from the appellant dated October 5, 2021, regarding his living conditions in Cameroon Letter from Ren\u00e9 Bikey-Amougou dated October 8, 2021, regarding the appellant\u2019s living conditions in Cameroon and the police search for the appellant Letter from Ren\u00e9 Bikey-Amougou dated October 6, 2021, regarding the appellant\u2019s detention upon returning to Cameroon and the police search for the appellant Letter from Christine Delphine Mbapp\u00e9 L\u00e9pp\u00e9 dated October 4, 2021, regarding the police search for the appellant Letter from Ren\u00e9 Bikey-Amougou dated October 5, 2021, regarding the police search for the appellant and his living conditions in Cameroon Medical report and prescriptions, October 15, 2021 Letter from Reverend Marcel Madjo N\u2019Tolla dated October 13, 2021, regarding the appellant\u2019s life in Cameroon Letter from Reverend Madjo N\u2019Tolla dated October 21, 2021 United Nations Report \u2013 Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, dated December 18, 2017, on Cameroon International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, November 30, 2017 Article from a website, Amnesty International, Cameroon 2020 (not dated) Article from a website, Human Rights Watch, September 22, 2021 After considering the new evidence presented on appeal (items 1 to 4), I am of the opinion that documents 1 and 3 arose after the RPD rendered its decision. They concern events that arose after the appellant found out that he was being represented by an individual who was practising law illegally and who had failed to file a notice of appeal against the RPD\u2019s decision. Clearly, this evidence was not available at the time of the decision, as it was unknown to the appellant prior to February 25, 2020. As a result, it could not have been presented prior to the RPD\u2019s decision. The evidence is new, credible and relevant to the central issue of this appeal, that is, the breach of natural justice that resulted from the appellant\u2019s representation before the RPD. Items 2 and 4 do not meet the legislative requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA and will not be admitted as new evidence. The content of the appellant\u2019s statement (item 2) concerns information that arose prior to the rejection of the refugee protection claim. It is a rewording of the appellant\u2019s Basis of Claim Form. The internet articles in item 4 are two news articles on the situation in Cameroon that predate the dismissal of the appeal and that were written and available before the rejection of the claim. These articles could reasonably have been filed prior to the RPD\u2019s decision. I am therefore of the opinion that items 2 and 4 are not new. The new evidence in items 5 to 22 was submitted by the appellant after the perfection of his appeal. I therefore considered the factors set out in subrule 29(4) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules). Here again, the appellant did not file any motion or written submissions regarding the admissibility of the new evidence, as required by the RAD Rules. On the basis of the record, I am able to rule on the admissibility of the evidence without additional submissions and I therefore relieve the appellant of the prescribed procedure. With respect to the relevance and probative value of these items, documents 5, 6, 7 and 9 are relevant to the appellant\u2019s allegation that there was a breach of natural justice that resulted in a breach of procedural fairness because his representative was not practising law legally. Item 8 is a Superior Court decision in the case between Mr. Jordan and the Barreau de Montr\u00e9al [Montr\u00e9al bar] that did not involve the appellant. The Court\u2019s decision in another case involving Mr. Jordan is not relevant or probative in Mr. Bikey-Amougou\u2019s appeal. Item 10 is a blog article on the illegal practice of law. The existence of this practice is not in dispute in this appeal, and I consider the article to be irrelevant to the central issues of the appeal. Items 19 to 22 are part of the RPD record and are included in the National Documentation Package (NDP) on Cameroon. They are therefore already part of the appeal record and do not constitute new evidence. They are not admitted as new evidence in the appeal. The requests concerning items 8, 10 and 19 to 22 are not allowed and these items are therefore not admitted. Items 11 to 15 consist of relevant and probative written testimony regarding the appellant\u2019s fear, his life as a fugitive, and the efforts of the Cameroonian police and government agents to find him. These issues are central to this appeal. The appellant\u2019s living conditions in Cameroon were obviously not known when he filed his appeal, prior to his removal to Cameroon. These documents could not have been presented with the appellant\u2019s record. Items 16 and 17 provide new information regarding the psychological and medical condition of the appellant, who is living in hiding. This information is relevant, although its weight remains to be established. Item 18 is a reference and support letter from the appellant\u2019s pastor in Montr\u00e9al confirming the appellant\u2019s good reputation within his religious community. It is not relevant to the issues to be determined in the appeal. Therefore, the request concerning item 18 is rejected, and this item is not admissible. With respect to whether the appellant could reasonably have been expected to have presented these documents with the appeal record, I am of the opinion that, since documents 5 to 17 concern events that arose after the appeal was perfected, the appellant could not have submitted them with the original version of the appeal record. After assessing the factors set out in rule 29, I am of the opinion that all of the evidence submitted after the appeal was perfected, with the exception of items 8, 10 and 18, meets the requirements of rule 29. Therefore, the application to use these documents is allowed. After considering the requirements set out in subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, I am of the opinion that, for the reasons I have described, all of the above documents, with the exception of items 8 and 10, arose after the rejection of the appellant\u2019s refugee protection claim. With respect to the factors set out in Singh, I am of the opinion that the evidence is relevant because, in general, it is central to the appellant\u2019s allegation regarding his fear of persecution by extremists. I also find that the appearance of the documents does not raise any credibility concerns: item 1 is a sworn affidavit, items 3, 5, 6, 7 and 9 are formal or official documents concerning the disciplinary complaint against Mr. Henri Jordan and items 11 to 16 and 18 are signed and dated statements from members of the appellant\u2019s family and community. These affiants provided identification documents with their statements. All of the items are relevant either to the issue of the actions of the appellant\u2019s counsel or to the risk to the appellant\u2019s life since his return to Cameroon. These issues are new and did not exist at the time of the RPD\u2019s decision. I will therefore admit items 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9 and 11 to 17. III. ORAL HEARING BEFORE THE REFUGEE APPEAL DIVISION The appellant requested an oral hearing before the RAD. The onus rests with the RAD to determine whether or not the criteria under subsection 110(6) of the IRPA have been met. In my opinion, the evidence that I have found to be admissible, in particular the appellant\u2019s statement dated October 5, 2021, and that of his brother, Ren\u00e9 Bikey-Amougou, raises issues that are central to the decision in this appeal. The credibility of the affidavits is an important issue in terms of making a finding regarding the appellant\u2019s overall credibility, and the credibility of his allegations concerning the risk he faces since returning to Cameroon. If the evidence in these affidavits is credible, it will be central to deciding the risk the appellant faces in Cameroon and would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. The affidavits justify holding an oral hearing before the RAD. An oral hearing was held on December 3, 2021. The Minister was notified of the oral hearing but did not participate. ANALYSIS OF THE APPEAL The role of the RAD is not to conduct a de novo consideration of a claim for refugee protection, but rather to determine whether the RPD erred as alleged. I conducted my own analysis of the record applying the correctness standard. In his memorandum, the appellant states that he was represented incompetently and illegally by Mr. Jordan because (a) the latter accepted fees before the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) when he had been disbarred, (b) he failed to file a notice of appeal when the appellant instructed him to do so, and (c) he failed to adequately represent the appellant\u2019s case before the RPD. The appellant also states that (d) his removal violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. I will not address the constitutionality of the appellant\u2019s removal, as the RAD does not have jurisdiction to rule on the removal order. I conclude that Mr. Jordan was remunerated in this case. He was not authorized to act as a paid representative before the RPD. He identified himself to the appellant as Me Jordan (that is, as a lawyer), and his representation was inadequate. For these reasons, I conclude that the proceeding and hearing before the RPD were tainted, resulting in a breach of the principles of natural justice. Furthermore, while I consider that a breach of natural justice warranting the RAD\u2019s intervention vitiates both the proceeding before the RPD and its decision, I wish to add that Mr. Jordan\u2019s failures in the RAD record caused significant harm to the appellant. IV. There was a breach of the principles of natural justice before the Refugee Protection Division The Practice Notice \u2013 Allegations Against Former Counsel does not apply The IRB has a practice notice that allows counsel to respond to allegations of incompetence. The purpose of the practice notice is to support the administration of justice and procedural justice. The practice notice states that a party must give notice to their former counsel of the allegations of incompetence so as to give them an opportunity to respond. The practice notice does not apply to Mr. Henri Jordan. It applies in cases where the person\u2019s former counsel is a lawyer, immigration consultant, or other person who is entitled to represent a person for a fee or other consideration at an IRB proceeding. However, Mr. Jordan was an unauthorized paid representative. However, in the spirit of the practice notice and to promote procedural fairness, the RAD followed the procedure in the practice notice. Therefore, in the decision dated May 11, 2021, concerning the extension of time to file the appeal, the appellant was instructed to notify Mr. Jordan of the allegations. The appellant followed the instructions he was given and sent the allegations and his memorandum to Mr. Jordan on October 13, 2021. Mr. Jordan has not responded. I also note that the allegations were the subject of a complaint to the Barreau and that a trial was held on August 31 and September 1, 2 and 3 in Montr\u00e9al (decision dated September 30, 2021). Mr. Jordan was undoubtedly aware of the allegations against him, but he did not respond until the RAD gave him another opportunity to comment on the Court of Qu\u00e9bec decision via a letter dated December 8, 2021 (reply dated December 20, 2021). Mr. Jordan was not authorized to represent the appellant before the Refugee Protection Division Under the IRPA, the persons who may represent or advise others before the IRB include lawyers who are members in good standing of a law society of a province, notaries who are members in good standing of the Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec [order of notaries of Quebec], students\u2011at\u2011law acting under the supervision of a lawyer or notary; any other members in good standing of a law society of a province or the Chambre des notaires du Qu\u00e9bec, including paralegals; and members in good standing of the College, as defined in section 2 of the . The persons listed in the paragraph above may represent individuals before the IRB for a fee. A limited category of people may also represent others on a pro bono basis without a fee, for example, family members, a community group or a member of a religious establishment. Although the legislation does not define unpaid representatives, I conclude that the list in subsection 91(2) of the IRPA of persons who may represent individuals is exhaustive. A representative who is not included in that list cannot charge a fee. This interpretation is consistent with the Policy for Handling Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Complaints Regarding Unauthorized, Paid Representatives, which states that an unpaid representative is anyone who does not charge a fee or is not receiving other consideration for representing, advising or consulting with a person who is the subject of a proceeding before the IRB, also known as a pro bono representative. A representative who receives any payment for these services at any time is considered to be a paid representative under subsection 91(2) of the IRPA. The appellant argues that Mr. Jordan was paid and states in his sworn affidavit that Mr. Jordan was paid $1,000.00 to represent him in his refugee protection claim before the RPD. In the Court of Qu\u00e9bec judgment dated September 30, 2021, the Court found Mr. Jordan guilty of unauthorized professional practice of law in his representation of Mr. Bikey-Amougou\u2019s refugee protection claim before the RPD, but did not comment on the issue of the appellant\u2019s payment of fees to Mr. Jordan. I note, however, that the prosecution\u2019s charges involving other individuals who appeared before the IRB confirmed a payment of fees by those individuals. Mr. Jordan\u2019s response I do not accept Mr. Jordan\u2019s submissions for the reasons that follow. Mr. Jordan was notified of the appellant\u2019s allegations against him in May 2021 and, in December 2021, he was asked to comment on the Court\u2019s judgment regarding Mr. Bikey-Amougou\u2019s case. In his response, he states that he did not identify himself as a lawyer to Mr. Bikey-Amougou or his family; he does not address the issue of a fee. In his comments, Mr. Jordan states that he is concerned about fraud in the immigration system and wants to expose the fraud committed by the appellant and his brother (his former clients). The panel finds it remarkable that Mr. Jordan would respond to an allegation of illegal conduct with more illegal conduct, namely, reporting his client\u2019s fraud without regard for the confidentiality of the discussions between himself and his former clients. He also explains that the appellant\u2019s sister is aware of her brothers\u2019 fraud, and he bases his accusations on the fact that many documents from Cameroon are fraudulent. Mr. Jordan concerns regarding the integrity of the immigration system are not credible. It was only after the Court of Qu\u00e9bec rendered a judgment and a guilty verdict that he reported the fraud allegedly committed by Mr. Bikey-Amougou and his brother, and after the family testified against Mr. Jordan before the Court of Qu\u00e9bec in that case. I also note that, if there was indeed fraud, Mr. Jordan apparently represented Mr. Bikey-Amougou in full knowledge of this. Mr. Jordan states that the appellant\u2019s family knew that he had not presented himself as a lawyer and that he had acted on a pro bono basis. He refers the panel to the representation form filed with the RPD. Upon verification, I note that the appellant and Mr. Jordan did indeed sign a statement on the day of the RPD hearing (November 9, 2019) to the effect that the representative was not being paid. The appellant also signed an affidavit on March 2, 2020, in which he contradicts this and states that he paid Mr. Jordan $1,000. I have listened to the RPD hearing and I note that the RPD member reviewed the Policy for Handling Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Complaints Regarding Unauthorized, Paid Representatives and verified certain points with Mr. Bikey-Amougou and Mr. Jordan. At the start of the hearing, the RPD member asked the appellant whether he was being represented by Mr. Jordan, whose name did not appear on the record. Mr. Bikey-Amougou replied spontaneously and at once that his sister, who knows Mr. Jordan, had recommended him as a representative. He confirmed that Mr. Jordan was his counsel and worked on a pro bono basis. The claimant sometimes referred to Mr. Jordan as Mr. Jordan and, at other times, as Ma\u00eetre Jordan, which led the member to ask Mr. Jordan if he was a lawyer. Mr. Jordan replied that he had been a lawyer but no longer was. The member then asked Mr. Jordan on what authority he was representing the claimant, to which Mr. Jordan replied that he had been inspired by the generosity of his parents and a desire to volunteer. I give little weight to these questions and responses. To begin with, neither Mr. Bikey-Amougou nor Mr. Jordan were under oath at the time of this discussion. Moreover, the member\u2019s questions were superficial formalities and not very thorough. They did not confront Mr. Jordan in any way and were asked in such a way that they did not seriously test the truthfulness of the responses and would not compel an individual to tell the truth in any way. It would have been preferable for Mr. Bikey-Amougou and his representative to have been under oath and questioned in such a way as to truly shed light on the issue of a fee while testing the truthfulness of their responses. That said, in my opinion, Mr. Bikey-Amougou\u2019s response was memorized. I find it surprising and not very credible that Mr. Bikey-Amougou spontaneously answered that Mr. Jordan was his representative and, in the same breath, that he represented him on a pro bono basis when the member had not asked about a fee. In my opinion, the unsolicited details about the pro bono nature of the representation are not details that arise naturally from the question but instead reflect a learned and memorized response. For these reasons, I find, on a balance of probabilities, that the representation form signed on the day of the hearing and the answers provided by Mr. Jordan and the appellant at the hearing are not credible, were memorized and are likely untrue. I therefore give greater weight to the appellant\u2019s affidavit, in which he states under oath that he paid Mr. Jordan the sum of $1,000. Lastly, Mr. Jordan states that the appellant\u2019s sister knew that he was not a lawyer. I consider it unlikely that the appellant\u2019s sister, who worked with Mr. Jordan at the Cameroonian consulate for many years, would be mistaken regarding the fact that he was being referred to as \u201cMa\u00eetre\u201d and was therefore presenting himself as a lawyer. The Court of Qu\u00e9bec did not accept Mr. Jordan\u2019s testimony on this subject, and I do not accept it either. I do not believe Mr. Jordan. Conclusions, breach of natural justice Mr. Jordan, who presented himself as Ma\u00eetre Jordan, was paid by the appellant\u2019s family to represent the appellant before the RPD, despite having been disbarred since 1998. He is not an immigration consultant and held no professional status that would allow him to accept fees. He had no authority to represent the appellant before the RPD. In fact, by representing the appellant, Mr. Jordan contravened the IRPA: 91(1) Subject to this section, no person shall knowingly, directly or indirectly, represent or advise a person for consideration \u2014 or offer to do so \u2014 in connection with the submission of an expression of interest under subsection 10.1(3) or a proceeding or application under this Act. \u2026 Penalties (9) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) commits an offence and is liable (a) on conviction on indictment, to a fine of not more than $200,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years, or to both; or (b) on summary conviction, to a fine of not more than $40,000 or to imprisonment for a term of not more than six months, or to both. By representing the appellant in this manner, Mr. Jordan was an impostor in the appellant\u2019s case before the RPD and acted illegally. This inadequate and illegal representation vitiates the entire proceeding, as well as the hearing before the RPD, and results in a breach of natural justice and procedural fairness, which constitutes an error that justifies the RAD\u2019s intervention. Despite my foregoing conclusion that the RAD\u2019s intervention is warranted, I find it important to note the harm suffered by the appellant as a result of Mr. Jordan\u2019s failure to act before the RAD. The record indicates that the RPD rejected Mr. Bikey-Amougou\u2019s refugee protection claim on November 26, 2019. The appellant instructed his counsel before the RPD to file an appeal before the RAD. The notice of appeal can be filed by sending a form that requires basic information, such as the appellant\u2019s name, date of birth, file number and address, along with counsel\u2019s names and addresses. This step is initially sufficient to preserve the right of appeal of a failed refugee protection claimant before the RPD. Mr. Jordan did not complete or submit this notice, nor did he notify Mr. Bikey-Amougou that he did not intend to do so. It should also be noted that, if no notice of appeal has been filed with the RAD, there is no stay of removal; therefore, failed refugee protection claimants before the RPD may be summoned by the CBSA to prepare for departure from Canada. This is precisely what happened to the appellant; on December 9, 2020, the appellant was summoned by the CBSA and detained until February 12, 2020. The appellant was deported to Cameroon on April 4, 2020. The Court of Qu\u00e9bec sentenced Mr. Jordan to pay a $10,000 fine for the charge involving Mr. Bikey-Amougou. In my view, Mr. Jordan\u2019s failure to act caused significant harm to the appellant, namely, the loss of his stay of removal, as well as the removal itself, and compromised his right to appeal the RPD\u2019s decision. The result is a risk to the appellant and a denial of his fundamental human rights. V. RISK ANALYSIS The appellant\u2019s record is similar to that of a person claiming refugee protection following events that occurred in their home country since their departure, or as a result of a significant increase in pre-existing factors since their departure. The appellant alleges that he fears the state by reason of his political opposition to the Cameroonian government. He testified that he founded a youth combat troupe named \u201cTroupe R\u00e9sistance Populaire.\u201d On the day the 13\u2011person troupe was founded (July 8, 2018), he was appointed commander, and two days later, he was arrested, detained, beaten and threatened with death because of his opposition to the government. The appellant was eventually released after his uncle paid a bribe. The appellant claims that he remained in hiding from the day of his release until he left for Canada on October 20, 2018 (he had already obtained a visa on October 1, 2018). He remained in Canada until April 4, 2020, when he was deported. During his oral hearing before the RAD on December 3, 2021, the appellant testified in particular about his arrest and detention upon arriving in Cameroon on Thursday, April 5 2020, about the abuse he suffered in detention, and the fact that he was beaten for tarnishing the image of Cameroon according to the police. He also testified about the bribe that was demanded for his release, his living conditions since returning to Cameroon, and the need to keep relocating to avoid being tracked down by the police. The appellant\u2019s brother, Mr. Ren\u00e9, also testified about the bribe, the exchange of money and the details of the appellant\u2019s release, as well as the appellant\u2019s relocations throughout Cameroon and how the police were attempting to track him down through his friends and family. Since his return to Cameroon Upon arriving at the airport in Douala, he was taken to the police station at the airport where he was asked to remove his shoes and belt. He stated that he was held in the airport cell for two days and beaten: he was struck in the abdomen and back and slapped in the face. He was threatened and was reportedly told that he would suffer and be tortured for tarnishing the image of Cameroon\u2019s government. The police officers demanded the sum of eighty-seven-thousand, three-hundred CFA (approximately $ one-hundred-eighty CDN) for his release. The appellant\u2019s brother eventually collected the money and paid the officers. The appellant\u2019s brother was instructed to take the appellant out of the capital, and on September 9, 2020, the appellant was therefore taken to his village to live with his older brother, where he stayed for four months. However, he had to leave the village because his older brother caught COVID and could not provide sufficient security for him. The appellant relocated to the village of Nguti, then to another village approximately an eight-hour drive from Yaound\u00e9, to the home of his aunt and her husband. That is where the appellant is currently hiding. He is cut off from everything, including his child, and states that his physical and psychological health is deteriorating, which his doctor confirms in a medical note filed in evidence. I note that, while it is not an official medical report, the doctor\u2019s notes are sufficiently credible for me to give the document some weight. The appellant receives occasional visits from family members. His sister, who visits him to bring him groceries, informed the appellant that she is still receiving threats from police officers who are looking for him. The appellant also testified that the police have approached his friends looking for him. The appellant\u2019s sister and his friend submitted letters confirming this. The appellant states that he has not heard from his wife, as she also left the country as a result of the appellant\u2019s actions. The appellant\u2019s brother testified. Ren\u00e9 Bikey-Amougou Ibrahim Mahama Assimba confirmed that he found the money required for the appellant to be released when he was incarcerated upon his return. He explained that he had met the police officers in a shady neighbourhood and that was when the appellant was handed over to him. He saw that his brother was traumatized and had been beaten. He confirmed that the appellant is living in hiding and that the family is living in [translation] \u201ca state of panic.\u201d According to the witness, the appellant is wanted and cannot possibly live in the capital. The police have allegedly visited Mr. Ren\u00e9 four times looking for the appellant since his return. The police have also visited (at night) the appellant\u2019s sister (Eliane). According to Mr. Ren\u00e9, the last police visit was in October 2021, when they questioned the appellant\u2019s aunt in Nguti. The appellant fears that if the police find him, he will be incarcerated in a prison for dissidents where the conditions are inhumane and that he would suffer severe abuse. The objective documentary evidence corroborates this treatment of dissidents. Determination The appellant has established his personal identity by means of his passport issued by the Cameroonian authorities. He testified candidly during the RAD\u2019s virtual hearing. His testimony was detailed and precise. He clearly explained the abuse he suffered upon his arrival and the reasons given by the police officers who beat him. He provided details of the life he lives as a fugitive to avoid being found by the authorities. His statements were corroborated by his brother\u2019s testimony. Their testimony was compatible and consistent with the affidavits they filed on the record. There are also numerous letters from family and friends confirming that the police are looking for the appellant and these are consistent with and support the testimony given by the appellant and his brother. There are also letters from his doctor and his pastor. Moreover, the appellant\u2019s testimony and documentary evidence are consistent with the NDP. In its entirety, the evidence is coherent, credible and internally consistent. The appellant is credible. The appellant has established that he was arrested and beaten by police officers in Cameroon after founding a dissident youth troupe in July 2018. He left Cameroon with a visa in October 2018 and claimed refugee protection in Canada. Since his removal to Cameroon, the appellant has been living in hiding. He was released after the police officers were paid a bribe; however, the authorities are actively looking for him. The evidence indicates that he is wanted by the police. While the appellant\u2019s fear initially involved a risk to his life owing to his involvement in the creation of the R\u00e9sistance Populaire troupe, the situation has changed, and his fear now encompasses not only a risk to his life based on his being a dissident, but also the fact that he filed a refugee protection claim in Canada and made allegations tarnishing the reputation of the Cameroonian government. The appellant\u2019s refugee protection claim reinforces his position as a dissident and undermines Cameroon in the eyes of its government. In my opinion, in light of the police officers\u2019 comments that they had beaten the appellant for tarnishing Cameroon\u2019s image abroad, it is now primarily by reason of the appellant\u2019s refugee protection claim that he is wanted by the police in Cameroon. The documentary evidence includes reports stating that Cameroonian authorities blame the diaspora for the outbreaks of violence that have plagued the country and do not hesitate to target Cameroonians who oppose the regime abroad. The same documentary evidence indicates that civilian authorities do not maintain effective control over the security forces and that the socio-political crisis that began in the northwest and southwest regions of the country in 2016 resulted in serious human rights violations and abuses committed by government forces. It confirms that Cameroonian authorities have intensified the crackdown against opponents. The documentary evidence refers to a massive government crackdown on demonstrations and political activities. The current president\u2019s regime is clearly intolerant and does not respect the fundamental rights of its citizens. Crackdowns have increased in recent years, limiting the ability of political opponents to operate freely and banning private meetings based on restrictions associated with COVID19. Individuals are not free to express or mount dissent against the current regime. Police officers arrest opponents, who are often arrested and incarcerated in unsanitary and overcrowded institutions. Mr. Bikey-Amougou has established the existence of a reasonable chance or serious possibility of future persecution by reason of his political opinion, in addition to the fact that he tarnished the regime\u2019s image by speaking out against it in his refugee protection claim in Canada. There is no adequate state protection or internal flight alternative The passages from the NDP cited above confirm that the security forces and the police are closely linked to the government. They participate in cracking down on opponents and act with complete impunity throughout the country. Freedom of expression is restricted, and journalists and demonstrators are arrested. The creation of opposition parties is greatly restricted and their members are arrested by the police. The authorities have continued to crack down on peaceful dissent, banning demonstrations and arbitrarily arresting those who exercise their rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. Amnesty International reports that four members of the Stand Up For Cameroon movement, a coalition of political parties, NGOs and others, were arrested by the gendarmerie in Douala after attending a meeting at the Cameroon People\u2019s Party headquarters. They were brought before a military court on false charges of attempted conspiracy, revolution and insurrection. The judge ordered their pre-trial detention in New Bell prison, where they remained at the end of the year. The police and the judicial system are instruments of repression. The police force and the gendarmerie, which are struggling with various political crises in the country, do not have the resources to protect citizens at risk, and police presence is non-existent in many areas of the country. In addition, there are reports of widespread corruption and bribery among security forces. Police officers continue to abuse their position with complete impunity. The testimony and letters submitted by the appellant\u2019s family and friends support the claim that the police are continuing to actively search for the appellant in different areas of the country. I am not satisfied that Mr. Bikey-Amougou does not face a serious risk of persecution in Cameroon. There is no internal flight alternative (IFA) in Cameroon for a political opponent or an individual who is perceived to have tarnished the government\u2019s image, and the state, as an agent of persecution, will not protect the appellant. I also note that the appellant is living in hiding and has relocated frequently. His physical and mental health is deteriorating. In my opinion, an IFA would not be reasonable in the appellant\u2019s particular circumstances. CONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons and in light of the most recent documentary evidence, I set aside the RPD\u2019s determination and substitute the determination that, in my opinion, should have been made, namely, that the appellant is a Convention refugee within the meaning of section 96 of the IRPA. The appeal is allowed.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200117 Dockets: IMM-1773-19 IMM-2874-19 Citation: 2020 FC 66 Ottawa, Ontario, January 17, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Ahmed BETWEEN: SERGIO ANTONIO REYES GARCIA Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Respondents JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] This case concerns the decision of a Canada Border Services Agency (\u201cCBSA\u201d) Border Services Officer (the \u201cOfficer\u201d) to cancel the Applicant\u2019s electronic travel authorization (\u201cETA\u201d) on a finding that the Applicant had misrepresented on the ETA and was therefore inadmissible for misrepresentation. [2] The Applicant is a citizen of Mexico, and was travelling from Mexico to Canada as a visitor with his family. Due to the discovery of undeclared currency during baggage inspection, the Applicant underwent a secondary examination for an in-depth interview with the Officer. At the end of the interview, the Applicant was found inadmissible for misrepresentation pursuant to subsection 40(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] on the Officer\u2019s conclusion that the Applicant misrepresented having been charged with a criminal offence. The Applicant withdrew his application pursuant to subsection 42(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [IRPR], and subsequently, the Applicant\u2019s ETA was cancelled pursuant to subsections 12.06(e) and 12.07 of the IRPR. [3] The Applicant submits that the Officer found the Applicant inadmissible for misrepresentation without the proper procedures and therefore had no jurisdiction to make such a determination, the Officer violated procedural fairness, and the Officer erred in concluding that the Applicant had misrepresented the facts. [4] For the reasons below, I find the Officer breached procedural fairness and that the Officer\u2019s decision is unreasonable. This application for judicial review is granted. II. Facts A. The Applicant [5] Sergio Antonio Reyes Garcia (the \u201cApplicant\u201d) is a 44-year-old citizen of Mexico. On January 28, 2018, the Applicant applied for an ETA. On the ETA application form, when asked whether he had been charged with or convicted of an offence, the Applicant stated that he had never been charged with or convicted of an offence. [6] On March 3, 2019, the Applicant travelled from Mexico City, Mexico to Vancouver International Airport via air. He was accompanied by his wife and their two children. The Applicant stated that he was travelling to Whistler, British Columbia for vacation. The Applicant had completed an E677 currency declaration form. However, during the baggage examination, additional unreported currency was discovered. The CBSA Border Services Officer interviewed the Applicant concerning the undeclared currency. The Officer writes in his affidavit that the Applicant provided multiple inconsistent and contradictory statements when questioned about the origins of the currency. Based on the \u201clegitimate origin concerns of the currency and further possible concerns regarding the [Applicant\u2019s] inadmissibility,\u201d the Applicant was subject to a further, more in-depth interview to determine admissibility. B. The Interview and Decision under Review [7] During the interview, the Officer asked about the Applicant\u2019s business interests and the source of the funds he was carrying with him. The Officer asked where the Applicant obtained funds to start his first company, how much the Applicant earned in income, and how much money he had in his accounts. The Officer questioned the Applicant on the amount of funds he had taken out for his travels, and the Applicant told the Officer that a woman named Christina exchanged his money. The Applicant stated that he had known Christina for ten years, but appeared to have little knowledge of her beyond the money exchanging services she provided for the Applicant. [8] The Officer delved into the Applicant\u2019s companies that he had mentioned and asked if the Applicant had been involved in any investigations regarding his businesses or business partners. The Applicant responded that he was never investigated. The Officer proceeded to question the Applicant on business transactions related to the Applicant\u2019s business partner, Manuel Barreiro, who was investigated by Mexican agencies for money laundering. The Applicant claimed that the allegations resulted from political issues. The Officer then referred to an article that mentioned the Applicant having been charged with an offence relating to illicit origin of funds. The Applicant stated he was never charged, although the authorities had wanted to charge him. [9] After a few lines of questioning about Manuel and his businesses, the Officer again turned the focus back to the Applicant as to whether he was ever \u201ccharged, convicted, or arrested of anything\u201d. The Applicant stated he did not understand what being \u201ccharged\u201d meant, so a Spanish interpreter was brought in to explain what the term meant in the context of a criminal investigation. Subsequently, the Applicant claimed that he understood what being \u201ccharged\u201d meant, and answered \u201cyes\u201d to having been charged, and several other questions of the Officer relating to this \u201ccharge\u201d. [10] During the interview, the Officer accessed the Applicant\u2019s email on his mobile phone and asked questions about meetings that were set up between the Applicant and his contacts who were allegedly accused of money laundering. The Officer concluded that the travel funds in the Applicant\u2019s possession were suspected proceeds of crime from the money-laundering scheme in Mexico. The Officer stated: My conclusion is that this money is suspected proceeds of crime. This money was derived from assertions based on information that you and your fellow co-defendants were charged with money laundering in Mexico in which you were aware of the business dealings of your fellow co-defendants including Barreiro who was orchestrating the movement of money through various shell companies including companies in Canada. By providing false companies and registering companies outside of Mexico, there was vast movement of money to various places around the world including Switzerland and Canada. [11] The Officer informed the Applicant that he was \u201cinadmissible to Canada for misrepresentation,\u201d because he \u201cfailed to indicate \u201cyes\u201d on [his] eTa application that [he was] arrested/charged/convicted of a crime\u201d although he purportedly knew of these charges before submitting the ETA application, according to the Officer\u2019s conclusions. [12] The Officer subsequently advised the Applicant that he could re-apply for his ETA, and noted that the Applicant would be required to answer all questions truthfully and provide documentation to confirm that he would not be inadmissible to Canada. The Officer reiterated this again at a later point. [13] Subsequently, the Applicant signed a form titled \u201cAllowed to Leave\u201d, which allowed the Applicant to voluntarily withdraw his application to enter Canada under subsection 42(1) of the IRPR. The Applicant\u2019s \u201cWithdrawal of the Application to Enter Canada\u201d form stated that the Applicant\u2019s ETA was cancelled for the following reasons: \u201cAs per section A40(a), You are inadmissible to Canada for Misrepresentation. You have withdrawn your application to enter Canada under subsection 42(1).\u201d [14] As noted by the Applicant, at no point during the process in which the Applicant was \u201cfound inadmissible\u201d was a s.44(1) report prepared by a CBSA Officer or the case sent to an admissibility hearing under s.44(2) of the IRPA. From the record, it appears that the Officer drew his own conclusions and determined that the Applicant was inadmissible for misrepresentation following the secondary interview. The Officer informed the Applicant that he was inadmissible to Canada, and based on the information provided by the Officer, the Applicant agreed to withdraw. Furthermore, the record shows no evidence of the Applicant having been advised of the consequences of a misrepresentation finding nor of the five-year bar on entering Canada. III. Issues and Standard of Review [15] There are three issues that arise on this application for judicial review: Did the Officer have the power to find the Applicant inadmissible for misrepresentation without writing a s.44(1) report and referring the matter to a Minister\u2019s Delegate, and as a result breach procedural fairness? Did the Officer err in cancelling the Applicant\u2019s ETA application? Did the Officer err in finding that the Applicant misrepresented on his ETA application? [16] As this case was heard prior to the release of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov], parties\u2019 submissions did not reflect the revised framework on standard of review. Nonetheless, in my view, the same standard of review would apply on the issues as under the previous framework in Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9. [17] Under the Vavilov framework, the analysis begins with the presumption of reasonableness. This presumption can be rebutted in two types of situations: first, where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard to apply, i.e. where it has explicitly prescribed the applicable standard of review, or where it has provided a statutory appeal mechanism from the administrative decision maker to a court; and second, where the rule of law requires that the standard of correctness be applied, for example in certain categories of legal questions, namely constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole and questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (Vavilov at para 17). [18] However, in assessing the Officer\u2019s decision to the finding of misrepresentation and the cancellation of the ETA, neither exception to the presumption applies. Thus, issues #2 and #3 are reviewable on a reasonableness standard. [19] Pre-Vavilov, issues of procedural fairness were reviewable on a correctness standard (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para 72). In Vavilov, this approach remains the same. In Vavilov at paragraph 23, the Supreme Court writes: Where a court reviews the merits of an administrative decision (i.e., judicial review of an administrative decisions other than a review related to a breach of natural justice and/or the duty of procedural fairness), the standard of review it applies must reflect the legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the role of the reviewing court, except where giving effect to that intent is precluded by the rule of law. The starting point for the analysis is a presumption that the legislature intended the standard of review to be reasonableness. [20] A reading of paragraphs 76 and 77 in Vavilov reveals the Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgement that the \u201crequirements of the duty of procedural fairness in a given case\u2026will impact how a court conducts reasonableness review.\u201d In my view, this is instructive for a reviewing court to first determine whether a duty of procedural fairness exists, and in light of the procedural fairness requirements (if applicable), apply the presumption of the reasonableness standard on the overall decision. In Vavilov, the duty of procedural fairness concerned whether reasons for the administrative decision was required and provided (Vavilov at para 78). Having found that reasons for both required and provided in this case, the Supreme Court moves onto its discussion on whether the decision is substantively reasonable. The following excerpt is also helpful, where the duty of procedural fairness is distinguished from the reasonableness analysis (Vavilov at para 81): [\u2026] The starting point for our analysis is therefore that where reasons are required, they are the primary mechanism by which administrative decision makers show that their decisions are reasonable \u2014 both to the affected parties and to the reviewing courts. It follows that the provision of reasons for an administrative decision may have implications for its legitimacy, including in terms both of whether it is procedurally fair and of whether it is substantively reasonable. [21] In my view, the correctness standard continues to apply to the issue of procedural fairness in the case at bar. IV. Statutory Framework [22] Under subsection 40(1)(a) of the IRPA, misrepresentation is one of the grounds for inadmissibility when entering Canada. It reads as follows: Misrepresentation 40 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible for misrepresentation (a) for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of this Act; Fausses d\u00e9clarations 40 (1) Emportent interdiction de territoire pour fausses d\u00e9clarations les faits suivants : a) directement ou indirectement, faire une pr\u00e9sentation erron\u00e9e sur un fait important quant \u00e0 un objet pertinent, ou une r\u00e9ticence sur ce fait, ce qui entra\u00eene ou risque d\u2019entra\u00eener une erreur dans l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi; [23] Subsection 44(1) of the IRPA describes a report that may be written by an officer upon an alleged inadmissibility of a foreign national or permanent resident and transmitted to the Minister\u2019s Delegate. Subsection 44(2) of the IRPA provides that if the report written pursuant to s.44(1) is well-founded, the Minister may refer this to the Immigration Division (\u201cID\u201d) for an admissibility hearing. The provisions read as follows: Preparation of report 44 (1) An officer who is of the opinion that a permanent resident or a foreign national who is in Canada is inadmissible may prepare a report setting out the relevant facts, which report shall be transmitted to the Minister. Referral or removal order (2) If the Minister is of the opinion that the report is well-founded, the Minister may refer the report to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing, except in the case of a permanent resident who is inadmissible solely on the grounds that they have failed to comply with the residency obligation under section 28 and except, in the circumstances prescribed by the regulations, in the case of a foreign national. In those cases, the Minister may make a removal order. Rapport d\u2019interdiction de territoire 44 (1) S\u2019il estime que le r\u00e9sident permanent ou l\u2019\u00e9tranger qui se trouve au Canada est interdit de territoire, l\u2019agent peut \u00e9tablir un rapport circonstanci\u00e9, qu\u2019il transmet au ministre. Suivi (2) S\u2019il estime le rapport bien fond\u00e9, le ministre peut d\u00e9f\u00e9rer l\u2019affaire \u00e0 la Section de l\u2019immigration pour enqu\u00eate, sauf s\u2019il s\u2019agit d\u2019un r\u00e9sident permanent interdit de territoire pour le seul motif qu\u2019il n\u2019a pas respect\u00e9 l\u2019obligation de r\u00e9sidence ou, dans les circonstances vis\u00e9es par les r\u00e8glements, d\u2019un \u00e9tranger; il peut alors prendre une mesure de renvoi. V. Analysis A. Breach of Procedural Fairness [24] The Applicant submits that the Officer was without jurisdiction to make a finding of misrepresentation pursuant to subsection 40(1)(a) of the IRPA because a finding of misrepresentation in the context of an application for admission to Canada at a port of entry (\u201cPOE\u201d) can only be made at an admissibility hearing. The Applicant also submits that he was not adequately provided with notice of the consequences of an inadmissibility finding, and not provided with a chance to respond through the proper channels. [25] The Respondent argues that if a foreign national has not been granted the right to enter Canada upon examination at a POE, they are not \u201ca foreign national in Canada\u201d for purposes of section 44 of the IRPA. The Respondent bases its submission on the wording in sections 44(1) and 18 of the IRPA, and argues that since the Applicant had not \u201centered\u201d Canada when the officer interviewed him, he was not a foreign national in Canada as described in subsection 44(1) of the IRPA, and thus the Officer had no obligation to prepare a s.44(1) report. [26] I note that the parties agree there was no formal finding of inadmissibility. The Respondent takes the position that there is no decision to set aside because the Officer did not make a formal determination and thus no misrepresentation finding. [27] The Applicant asks the Court to provide a clear indication that there is no five-year bar from entry, and that the Officer did not have jurisdiction to make a \u201cfinding\u201d of inadmissibility. [28] The Respondent, in reply, noted that there is nothing in the record regarding the five-year bar. The Respondent submits that the conversation between the Officer and the Applicant would have discussed the bar if it had a relevant application to the Applicant. The Respondent notes that the Applicant\u2019s affidavit is the only place where the five-year bar is discussed. [29] However, I am not persuaded by the Respondent\u2019s submissions. Although the Officer did not state a five-year bar, the bar does not derive from the Officer\u2019s delegated authority\u2014but rather from the operation of statute. Furthermore, in my view, the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of sections 44(1) and 18 of the IRPA is incorrect. Subsection 37(1) of the IRPR states (with my emphasis added): 37 (1) Subject to subsection (2), the examination of a person who seeks to enter Canada, or who makes an application to transit through Canada, ends only when (a) a determination is made that the person has a right to enter Canada, or is authorized to enter Canada as a temporary resident or permanent resident, the person is authorized to leave the port of entry at which the examination takes place and the person leaves the port of entry; (b) if the person is an in-transit passenger, the person departs from Canada; (c) the person is authorized to withdraw their application to enter Canada and an officer verifies their departure from Canada; or (d) a decision in respect of the person is made under subsection 44(2) of the Act and the person leaves the port of entry. 37 (1) Sous r\u00e9serve du paragraphe (2), le contr\u00f4le de la personne qui cherche \u00e0 entrer au Canada ou qui fait une demande de transit ne prend fin que lorsqu\u2019un des \u00e9v\u00e9nements ci-apr\u00e8s survient : a) une d\u00e9cision est rendue selon laquelle la personne a le droit d\u2019entrer au Canada ou est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 entrer au Canada \u00e0 titre de r\u00e9sident temporaire ou de r\u00e9sident permanent, la personne est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 quitter le point d\u2019entr\u00e9e o\u00f9 le contr\u00f4le est effectu\u00e9 et quitte le point d\u2019entr\u00e9e; b) le passager en transit quitte le Canada; c) la personne est autoris\u00e9e \u00e0 retirer sa demande d\u2019entr\u00e9e au Canada et l\u2019agent constate son d\u00e9part du Canada; d) une d\u00e9cision est rendue en vertu du paragraphe 44(2) de la Loi \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de cette personne et celle-ci quitte le point d\u2019entr\u00e9e. [30] The wording of subsection 37(1) of the IRPR shows that one possibility for the end of an examination for a person seeking to enter Canada is a decision under subsection 44(2) of the IRPA. The Applicant did not have to be formally \u201cadmitted\u201d into Canada before the Officer could prepare a s.44(1) report. Furthermore, the Respondent appears to have misconstrued the inadmissibility determination process. For a finding of inadmissibility, the procedure at a POE requires an officer to prepare a s.44(1) report setting out allegations, which is then referred to a Minister\u2019s Delegate for a section 44(2) determination. Pursuant to subsection 44(2) of the IRPA, the Minister\u2019s Delegate may refer the report to the ID for an admissibility hearing, if they are of the opinion that the report is well-founded. Since a report involving allegations of misrepresentation under subsection 40(1)(a) of the IRPA does not fall under one of the circumstances that \u201cshall not be referred to the Immigration Division\u201d pursuant to subsection 228(1) of the IRPR, it follows that the matter would need to be referred to an admissibility hearing as a next step. [31] Whether the Officer acted without proper authority in making his own admissibility determination deserves a close reading and interpretation of the word \u201cmay\u201d in subsection 44(1) of the IRPA and the scope of discretion afforded by the provision. [32] In Correia v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 782 (CanLII) [Correia], this Court discussed subsection 44(1) of the IRPA with regard to a CBSA officer\u2019s \u201cformation of the opinion as to inadmissibility\u201d and \u201cthe decision to make a report\u201d (Correia at para 20): The decision to make a report must be considered against the backdrop of this Division of the Act which has as its purpose the removal of certain persons from Canada. The discretion not to report must be extremely limited and rare otherwise it would give to officials a level of discretion not even enjoyed by the responsible Minister. [33] In case law that discusses the interpretation of subsection 44(1) and the discretion given to officers, the analysis is focused on whether and to what extent officers can consider various factors in making a decision to prepare the s.44(1) report. For example, this Court has discussed whether an immigration officer has the discretion to consider humanitarian and compassionate grounds under section 44 of the IRPA, and whether immigration officers are obligated to take factors listed on Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada\u2019s (\u201cIRCC\u201d) Operational Manuals into consideration (See Melendez v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FC 1363 (CanLII) at paras 17-31). Hernandez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 429 (CanLII) at para 29 offers an example as well (emphasis in original): In spite of this clarity regarding inadmissibility under paragraph 36(1)(a), subsection 44(1) allows a residual discretion in the immigration officer. Once the immigration officer reaches his opinion of inadmissibility, the officer \u201cmay prepare a report setting out the relevant facts\u201d. The IRPA does not set out what \u201crelevant facts\u201d would be. Nor does it confine the discretion of the officer in preparing a report. Parliament has not provided any direction to how these officials are to carry out their duties under these provisions. [34] Neither the jurisprudence nor a reading of the relevant statutory provisions offer support for the proposition that officers have the discretion to make their own admissibility determinations without writing a s.44(1) report. The discretion under subsection 44(1) of the IRPA does not empower immigration officers to make an admissibility finding themselves, but rather allows officers to report their opinion of inadmissibility of an applicant, should they reach one given the evidence before them. [35] Although the case at bar involves a non-criminal inadmissibility section, I note that some cases involving inadmissibility based on criminality even go as far to completely reduce the discretion that officers may have in writing s.44(1) reports, and treat it merely as \u201can administrative function\u201d, which demonstrates that in certain cases, officers have a severely narrowed discretion and are essentially required to write the s.44(1) report. Awed v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 469 (CanLII) at paras 10 and 18 notes two such cases: [10] In Correia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2004), 253 F.T.R. 153, 2004 FC 782 (CanLII), Justice Michael Phelan viewed the report made by the officer under s. 44(1) as essentially an administrative function, lacking any scope for the exercise of discretion on the part of the officer. The report under subsection 44(1), he concluded, is restricted to the relevant facts, and in the case of criminality the relevant facts are those pertaining to the fact of conviction. [\u2026] [\u2026] [18] In my view, where an interview is held under s.44 (1), the purpose of the interview is simply to confirm the facts that may support the formation of an opinion by the officer that a permanent resident or foreign national present in Canada is inadmissible. The use of the word \"may\" in s. 44(1) does not connote discretion but merely that the officer is authorized to perform an administrative function: Ruby v. Canada (Solicitor General) (C.A.), 2000 CanLII 17145 (FCA), [2000] 3 F.C. 589 at 623 - 626, 187 D.L.R. (4th) 675 (F.C.A.). [36] An understanding of the discretionary aspect of subsection 44(1) of the IRPA can also be informed by IRCC\u2019s Operational Manuals. \u201cENF 3: Admissibility, Hearings and Detention Review Proceedings\u201d [ENF 3] notes that a s.44(1) report is \u201cthe legal document that gives the [Minister\u2019s Delegate] the authority to issue a removal order or to refer the matter for an admissibility hearing, as prescribed by R228 and R229.\u201d [37] \u201cENF 5: Writing 44(1) Reports\u201d [ENF 5] outlines the procedure for immigration officers when they make a decision to write a s.44(1) report. It provides guidance as follows (ENF 5, page 8) [my own emphasis added]: The fact that officers have the discretionary power to decide whether or not to write n inadmissibility report does not mean that they can disregard the fact that someone is, or may be, inadmissible, or that they can grant status to that person under A21 and A22. Rather, this discretion gives officers flexibility in managing cases where no removal order will be sought, or where the circumstances are such that the objectives of the Act may or will be achieved without the need to write a formal inadmissibility report under the provisions of A44(1). [38] The discretion as described in ENF 5 is one that \u201cgives officers flexibility in managing cases\u201d, and not a discretion or authority for the officers themselves to make conclusive inadmissibility determinations. ENF 5 provides further insight into the nature of discretion and the word \u201cmay\u201d in subsection 44(1) of the IRPA through a list of factors. A non-exhaustive list of factors for officers to consider in assessing a non-criminal inadmissibility includes: whether the person is already the subject of a removal order; whether the person is already subject to a separate inadmissibility report that will likely result in a removal order; whether the person has been fully counselled on the topic of their inadmissibility; and whether there is any evidence of misrepresentation. [39] On a plain reading, some of these factors allude to situations where an officer could exercise the discretion not to write a s.44(1) report because the preparation of a separate s.44(1) report would result in duplicated efforts for removal if the person concerned is likely to be or already subject to a removal order. None of the listed factors indicate that the discretion for an officer not to write a s.44(1) report flows from some authority of the officer to make an admissibility determination on their own. [40] In the case at bar, there was no indication that a s.44(1) report was written or that a referral was made to the Minister\u2019s Delegate. However, during the interview, the Officer came to his own determination on admissibility by stating, \u201cYou are inadmissible to Canada for misrepresentation. You failed to indicate \u2018yes\u2019 on your eTa application that you were arrested/charged/convicted of a crime\u201d. In this regard, the Officer acted without proper authority and erred in making an admissibility finding based on misrepresentation. As such, the Applicant was deprived of the procedural fairness that would have been accorded under subsections 44(1) and 44(2) of the IRPA. B. Cancellation of ETA Application [41] As the Applicant notes, \u201cENF 4: Port of entry examinations\u201d [ENF 4] states that a Border Services Officer who is a Minister\u2019s Delegate may cancel an ETA when certain conditions are met. It reads as follows: As per the CBSA OB PRG-2016-22, a BSO who is an MD (refer to OPS-2015-12 OB) may cancel an eTA when the following conditions are met: Following the preparation of an A44(1) report by an officer; and If the foreign national is subject to an enforceable removal order issued by the MD; and Following a review of the report by an MD who forms his/her own conclusions regarding inadmissibility based on careful considerations of facts and evidence and only after having met the fairness requirement. If the MD does not have the delegated authority to issue a removal order and instead refers the report to the Immigration Division (ID) for an admissibility hearing, a decision on eTA cancellation should be deferred until a removal order is issued as a result of the admissibility hearing. The cancellation of the eTA should not merely be based on the fact that a removal order has been issued, unless the delegated officer forms his/her own conclusions concerning inadmissibility. This should be articulated in the officer notes. [42] One of the conditions to be met is \u201cthe preparation of an A44(1) report by an officer\u201d (ENF 4, section 13.14 \u201ceTA validity and cancellation\u201d). However, since a s.44(1) report was not prepared in the case at bar, the Officer erred in listing inadmissibility for misrepresentation as one of the grounds for cancelling the ETA. [43] The Respondent submits that the Officer properly cancelled the Applicant\u2019s ETA because the Applicant had voluntarily withdrawn his application to enter Canada pursuant to section 42(1) of the IRPA. The Respondent relies on section 12.06(e) of the IRPR for this proposition. Section 12.06(e) of the IRPR states that a foreign national who holds an ETA becomes \u201cineligible\u201d to hold the ETA upon withdrawal of their application to enter Canada. Furthermore, section 12.07 of the IRPR states: 12.07 An officer may cancel an electronic travel authorization that was issued to a foreign national if the foreign national is inadmissible or becomes ineligible to hold such an authorization under section 12.06. 12.07 Un agent peut annuler une autorisation de voyage \u00e9lectronique d\u00e9livr\u00e9e \u00e0 un \u00e9tranger si ce dernier est interdit de territoire ou s\u2019il n\u2019est plus habilit\u00e9, aux termes de l\u2019article 12.06, \u00e0 en d\u00e9tenir une. [44] The Respondent submits that based on the interview conversation and the evidence before him, it was reasonable for the Officer to cancel the ETA. The Respondent argues that the Officer relied on the interview and open source articles, which pointed to charges against the Applicant. [45] However, the Applicant notes that while the open source articles discuss investigations, they do not mention formal charges. The Applicant asserts the decision to make a misrepresentation finding based on this information was unreasonable because the articles never clearly stated that there were charges. [46] In my view, it was reasonable for the Officer to cancel the Applicant\u2019s ETA on the basis that the Applicant had become ineligible to hold it upon withdrawal of his application to enter Canada under subsection 42(1) of the IRPA. That being said, however, the Officer erred in finding that misrepresentation was a ground for cancellation of the ETA. C. Finding of Misrepresentation [47] The Applicant submits that the Officer erred in finding that the Applicant misrepresented, as he was never charged with an offence in Mexico. The Applicant notes in his affidavit that he answered \u201cyes\u201d to a question related to allegations made against him, but claims that he never stated he had been charged with an offence. [48] The Respondent submits that the Officer\u2019s finding of misrepresentation was reasonable as it was based on the Applicant\u2019s answers in his ETA application and those given during the interview. The Respondent argues that the Officer presented public source information regarding the alleged money laundering, and the Applicant had an opportunity to respond to the Officer\u2019s concerns. [49] In my view, it was open to the Officer to form his own opinion as to an alleged misrepresentation based on the interview and the Applicant\u2019s ETA application based on the evidence before him. The Applicant stated in his application that he had never been charged with or convicted of an offence. Then during the interview, when it appeared that the Applicant did not fully understand what being \u201ccharged\u201d meant, an on-site Spanish interpreter was brought in to explain the term\u2019s meaning in the context of a criminal investigation. The Officer provided instructions for the interpreter to explain to the Applicant the meaning of \u201ccharged\u201d and its distinction from a conviction. The Applicant subsequently stated that he \u201cunderstand[s] now what charge means\u201d. Then upon the Officer\u2019s question as to whether he was charged with anything, the Applicant replied, \u201cYes, I was\u201d\u2014an answer contrary to what he had stated in the ETA application. Based on the evidence, it was reasonable for the Officer to have formed an opinion that the Applicant could be inadmissible on the ground of misrepresentation. [50] However, although it was open to the Officer to form an opinion as to an alleged misrepresentation, as I noted above, the Officer did not have the authority to make a final admissibility determination. Only the Minister\u2019s Delegate or the ID may make such findings. Therefore, the Officer erred in finding that the Applicant had misrepresented and that he was therefore inadmissible. VI. Certified Question [51] Counsel for each party was asked if there were any questions requiring certification. They each stated that there were no questions for certification and I concur. VII. Conclusion [52] The Officer\u2019s decision is unreasonable and the Officer breached procedural fairness. The Officer erred in making his own determination of an admissibility finding, as he lacked authority to do so. For an admissibility finding, the Officer was required to prepare and transmit a s.44(1) report to the Minister\u2019s Delegate. As the Officer acted without jurisdiction, he stripped the Applicant of procedural fairness that the Applicant would have been provided with under the proper procedure. Moreover, the Officer erred in listing inadmissibility based on misrepresentation as a ground for cancelling the ETA. Lastly, the Officer erred in finding the Applicant had misrepresented. He simply could not conclude so, for the reasons stated above. [53] Therefore, this application for judicial review is allowed.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TC009201 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Marjorie Nakazibwe (the Appellant) is a citizen of Uganda. She appeals the decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) denying her claim for refugee protection, and requests that the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) find that she is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. In the alternative, she requests that the RAD remit the matter to be reheard before the RPD. DECISION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection. BACKGROUND The Appellant alleges she fears persecution in Uganda at the hands of a tycoon, Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, who she claims illegally usurped her inherited land, and from the state due to her opposition to the government\u2019s political program in her village. The Appellant left her country on June 8, 2018 and arrived in Canada on June 9, 2018, via plane. She made her claim for refugee protection at the airport upon arrival. NEW EVIDENCE Although the Appellant submitted a written statement indicating that she was relying on new evidence, no new evidence was included with the Appellant\u2019s Record, nor was new evidence raised at any point in the Appellant\u2019s memorandum. As such, no new evidence has been admitted in this appeal. ANALYSIS My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. The RPD rejected the Appellant\u2019s claim, finding that the Appellant had failed to establish a nexus to a Convention ground, as efforts to reclaim disputed land do not fall into the category of \u201cpolitical opinion\u201d and the claim therefore failed under section 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The RPD also found the claim failed under section 97 of the IRPA, as the right to private property is not a fundamental right and the Appellant had failed to establish a personalized risk. Furthermore, the RPD found it is reasonable to expect that the Appellant would take measures, including giving up or abandoning her land claim, which would eliminate her forward-looking risk before seeking refugee protection. The Appellant raises four issues in the present appeal: That the RPD violated procedural fairness by applying Guideline 7 in a manner that improperly fettered its discretion; That the RPD\u2019s assessment of the evidence was patently unreasonable, perverse and/or capricious, and was unfairly assessed; That the RPD erred in finding that the claim had no nexus to a Convention ground, and misconstrued law and facts in concluding that the Appellant had failed to establish persecution based on her political opinion; and That the RPD erred in its application of section 97 of the IRPA and its conclusion that the Appellant is not a person in need of protection. Issue i) The RPD did not breach procedural fairness The Appellant alleges that the RPD\u2019s questioning during her hearing was \u201cclearly geared towards a particular outcome,\u201d rather than questioning the Appellant to gather information in order to make an informed decision in her case. She alleges that the RPD \u201cavoided\u201d questioning related to the Ugandan police and authorities\u2019 involvement in her claim, in order to conclude that her claim is that of a land dispute between two parties, which falls outside the scope of section 96. The Appellant alleges the RPD misstated her testimony in order to reach the conclusion that she had failed to establish a nexus to a Convention ground. The Appellant points to one sentence made during her hearing, wherein the RPD asked the Appellant why she had not mentioned the government as an agent of persecution earlier in her testimony, and the Appellant told the RPD panel that it was because he \u201cdid not ask,\u201d to which the RPD replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t have to ask, it\u2019s your claim\u2026\u201d The Appellant states this reference by the RPD to not \u201chaving to ask\u201d amounts to \u201cnonfeasance and a breach of a duty of procedural fairness\u201d as, in her view, the RPD \u201cavoided\u201d questions relating to her claim that the government is an agent of persecution. I have reviewed the transcript of the Appellant\u2019s hearing in its entirety, and I find this one sentence is taken out of context, and is not representative of the totality of the hearing, which was over three hours in length, during which time the Appellant did testify as to why she fears the Government of Uganda. The Appellant was represented by counsel, who was given an opportunity to question on areas the Appellant wished to highlight, including her fear of persecution at the hands of the government. The Appellant, during the course of questioning by the RPD and her counsel, was given ample opportunity to speak to her experience in Uganda, her agents of persecution and the reasons for which she was targeted. The Appellant indicated in response to both the RPD and her counsel that she feared the Ugandan government, as well as the local \u201ctycoon\u201d named Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, but consistently testified that named Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda was behind any negative attention she received from the Ugandan government, as will be elaborated upon below. While the Appellant points to sections of the transcript of the RPD hearing which focused on her claim that she fears the individual, Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda; it is clear from a review of the entirety of the transcript, that the Appellant was given ample opportunity to speak to how she believes the government of Uganda and/or the police or other state authorities would target her. Therefore I am not persuaded that the RPD breached procedural fairness or in any way misapplied Guideline 7, as alleged. I find that this argument is not determinative. Issue ii) The RPD\u2019s assessment of the evidence was not patently unreasonable, perverse and/or capricious, nor was it unfairly assessed The Appellant argues that the RPD misconstrued her evidence to classify the basis of her claim as a land dispute between two parties \u2013 the Appellant, who inherited land given to her grandparents by will upon death, and Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, who claims to own the land on the basis of the Uganda High Court decision \u2013 when in fact her testimony was that a whole village was unfairly evicted from all of their lands, and the Appellant was fighting not just for her land but for the whole community as well. I do not find that the RPD misconstrued or erroneously assessed her evidence. The basis of the Appellant\u2019s claim is the loss of her land to Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, who she says used false or fraudulent land title claims to take the Appellant\u2019s family\u2019s land, along with others in the same area. The claim has since been pursued in the courts in Uganda, according to the Appellant. As set out below with reference to the Appellant\u2019s Basis of Claim (BOC) and oral evidence, I find the source of the Appellant\u2019s claim is the land issue, and though she thereafter made efforts to reclaim the land and advocate for herself and the community, this advocacy relates to seeking the return of the land and cannot be said to have occurred as a result of government opposition or political activity/opinion on the part of the Appellant, nor am I persuaded on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellant is viewed as such by the Ugandan authorities, according to her evidence and as set out below. This is not a case where I am \u201cpersuaded that the analysis of the CRDD [now RPD] in support its assessment of credibility is so flawed or incomplete that it cannot be determined with any degree of certainty that the assessment is other than perverse or capricious or made without regard to the evidence before it,\u201d as alleged by the Appellant. I cannot find that the RPD misconstrued the evidence, or treated it in a way that could be said to be patently unreasonable, perverse, capricious, or improperly assessed, as alleged. Issue iii) The RPD did not err in finding that the claim had no nexus to a Convention ground or that the Appellant had failed to establish persecution based on her political opinion The RPD in its decision relied on the case of Ndambi, and found that in the Appellant\u2019s case \u201cthere is no element of \u2018political opinion\u2019 in play,\u201d and therefore the Appellant had not established a nexus to a Convention ground. The Appellant argues in this appeal that the persecution she claims to have experienced in Uganda has a nexus to the Convention on the basis of political opinion, namely that she is seen by the state as being anti-government for her work to reclaim her land from Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, and in mobilizing the community to do the same. Yet, I am not persuaded that the evidence supports this finding. The Appellant\u2019s BOC consistently indicates that the source of her problems emanates from an individual named Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda who took her family land, and emphasizing that: [Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda] is trying to use government through the police and the resident district commissioner to evict and harm me claiming that I am trying to frustrate government program related to the oil exploration, refinery and waste disposition in eastern district by organizing the villager to resist the eviction from our land. [emphasis added] Also the Appellant asserts \u201c[T]his was all [Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda] who had evicted people after using state operatives and collaborating with the Regional Police Commander and Assistant Resident District Commissioner\u2026\u201d [emphasis added]. The Appellant states in her BOC that it was Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda who has used his connections in government to influence those in power to suggest that the Appellant is anti-government and is trying to frustrate programs relating to oil in the area, and for this reason she started receiving threatening anonymous calls from \u201cpeople claiming to be calling from State House\u201d ordering her to stop fighting for the land. Therefore, in the RAD\u2019s view, the Appellant\u2019s evidence appears to demonstrate that she is/was being targeted by Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, who used his government connections for reasons related to the land dispute, and not that she is being targeted by the Government of Uganda for reasons relating to her real or imputed political opinion or being \u201canti-government\u201d. The Appellant attempts to distinguish her case from Ndambi, and argues that in the case of Ndambi, it was an individual trying to get back land that he alleged belongs to him, while in her case the Appellant is fighting for land that belongs to the community against the interest of government in an oil rich region of Uganda. She states that the RPD erred in \u201ccopying and pasting\u201d the Ndambi case to her situation. The Appellant argues that her case is distinct in that she is a key witness in the land claim which will be heard by the Uganda High Court Appeal and that she has been mobilizing the community to go against the eviction, which she also asserted before the RPD. However, the RPD noted that the Appellant admitted that she had not submitted any evidence to substantiate her allegation that the Government of Uganda considers her anti-government. After my own independent assessment I have arrived at the same conclusion. I find that the Appellant\u2019s evidence suggests that her case is, in essence, a land dispute, and I do not find it is distinguishable from Ndambi. Nor is it a case of \u201copposition to corruption as an expression of political opinion\u201d, as characterized in the jurisprudence cited by the Appellant. While the Appellant has made efforts to mobilize the community to reclaim their collective land, her evidence indicates the impetus for doing so is not her political opinion, but rather a desire to reclaim her own land. I agree with the RPD in finding that the Appellant has failed to establish a nexus to the Convention, and as such her claim fails under section 96 of the IRPA. Issue iv) The RPD did not err in its application of section 97 of the IRPA and its conclusion that the Appellant is not a person in need of protection The Appellant alleges first, that the RPD erred in its application of section 97 and in finding that she \u201cis not a person in need of protection as she merely faces a generalized risk.\u201d In the next line, the Appellant also argues second, that the RPD \u201cfailed to conduct any section 97 analysis.\u201d This is not a case similar to those cited by the Appellant where \u201cthe RPD limited itself to stating the law,\u201d where no \u201creferences to the facts were made to contextualize the legal process followed.\u201d It is clear from a plain reading of the decision that the RPD did undertake a section 97 analysis in respect of the Appellant\u2019s claim, giving rise to the Appellant\u2019s argument that the RPD erred in its application of section 97 and thus disposing of the Appellant\u2019s second argument. In respect of the first argument that the RPD erred in its application of section 97 of the IRPA, a clear review of the decision indicates that the RPD found it is reasonable and consistent with jurisprudence to expect the Appellant to take all reasonable measures to eliminate the risk she faces in her country of reference before seeking refugee protection elsewhere, including, in this case, that the Appellant forego or not pursue her land claim in order to protect herself. The RPD found that if the Appellant abandoned her claim to the land taken by Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, this would remove the motivation for Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda to continue pursuing her, and therefore she would not face a forward-looking risk. In the RAD\u2019s view, this issue is determinative of the section 97 claim. The Appellant asserts that the RPD erred in defining the basis of the Appellant\u2019s claim as a land dispute between the Appellant and Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, when in her view, the legal action filed in Uganda is sufficient to demonstrate that \u201cthis matter concerns a community and not as the Panel member misconstrued as just two parties.\u201d She claims that even if she were to abandon her claim to the land, \u201cher life would never be safe because the case would not stop\u201d simply as a result of the Appellant withdrawing her claim to the land. She claims that even if she were to do so, she would still face \u201cdanger\u201d from the agents of persecution, or at the hands of \u201cother evictees who would still want to continue with the fight for the land.\u201d I find that the Appellant can reasonably be expected to surrender her interests in the disputed land claim in order to mitigate her forward-looking risk. Firstly, I agree with the RPD that the record clearly establishes that the issue between the Appellant and Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda \u2013 including any government agent of persecution, given the Appellant\u2019s evidence that the government is acting on the instruction, or under the influence, of Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda \u2013 is based on the issue of who has claim to the property taken from the Appellant\u2019s family by Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, and which is now before the courts in Uganda. The evidence in the record, including the lawyer\u2019s letter and the Appellant\u2019s own written evidence, points to this being the central issue and source of conflict. Therefore, I find that the RPD was correct in concluding that if the Appellant stopped pursuing this issue, then Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, and by extension any government agents of persecution acting at his behest, would no longer be interested in pursuing her. I also agree with the RPD that the Appellant\u2019s interest in the land is not a guaranteed right or fundamental freedom. The court has held that \u201cclaimants who are able to make reasonable choices and thereby free themselves of a risk of harm must be expected to pursue those options\u201d I find that the Appellant could make the reasonable choice to end her land dispute with Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda, and that this would free her from any future potential harm. In considering the issue of whether these types of reasonable efforts can include a requirement for someone in the Appellant\u2019s position to stop pursuing a land claim or property dispute, the court has held that it is reasonable to require that they do so. In Kenguruka, the Court held that the applicant\u2019s refugee claim that had been rejected by the RPD because his inheritance claim, which lead to threats of violence, did not constitute a basis for refugee protection. Justice Harrington stated: [7] In light of the record, the panel did not act in an unreasonable manner when it decided that Mr. Kenguruka would not face persecution in Burundi if he abandoned his claim to the property that he inherited from his parents. \u2026 If Mr. Kenguruka were arguing a right set out in the Convention and section 96, such as his right to freely practice his religion, he could not be forced to renounce his religion in order to avoid persecution. This reasoning is echoed by Justice Walker in Malik where the Court held that it was reasonable for the RPD to conclude that the claimants could avoid a risk to life by no longer pursuing a lawsuit related to an inheritance dispute. I find that these principles apply to the Appellant\u2019s claim as her conflict with Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda is based on her attempts and efforts to maintain control over property which she alleges was fraudulently taken by Richard Thomas Sekandi Ssekiranda for personal gain or profit. As such, I agree with the RPD that the Appellant can avoid a future risk to life by no longer pursuing this land claim. I am not persuaded by the Appellant\u2019s speculative assertion that she would be unable to extricate herself from the legal proceedings involving this land, nor am I persuaded that the risk she alleges based on her claim to this land and advocacy for all those who lost land alongside her would not be mitigated to the point of falling below a serious possibility of persecution if she abandoned her claim. There is also insufficient basis to find in favour of the Appellant\u2019s speculative assertion that she would face a risk of section 97 harm at the hands of other evictees who wish to continue to fight for the land, as no reason has been provided as to why other evictees would have an interest in harming the Appellant, as their interests could continue to be pursued in the courts, regardless of the Appellant\u2019s personal involvement. The Appellant\u2019s assertion that she might be summoned as a witness in the court case for the land, and that that would present an obstacle to extricating herself from the legal proceedings relating to the land claim made by the community, is speculative. I cannot find that this speculative assertion that she might be called as a witness in the case would in itself give rise risk to a section 97 risk to the Appellant such as would ground a finding that she is a protected person under that section. The Appellant also argues that the RPD breached procedural fairness by not justifying its finding that the Appellant is not a person in need of protection, as she states \u201cthe RPD did not in any way consider the country condition of Uganda,\u201d and does not cover \u201call the relevant facts the Appellant mention[ed] during the hearing.\u201d The Appellant relies on the National Documentation Package evidence for Uganda, specifically a Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Uganda, which lists in general terms human rights violations which occur in Uganda, including inter alia unlawful or arbitrary killings, forced disappearance, torture, violence and intimidation against journalists, restrictions on political participation, corruption, and harassment and detention of LGBTI individuals, and on this basis asserts that the RPD erred in failing to make any finding to the effect that the Appellant: \u2026 shared the same risk as other persons similarly situated like her as a key witness in an ongoing case in which a community is on one side and the government of Uganda and a rich connected person is on the other side, a conclusion that could only be reached after having considered the specific circumstances of the applicant in light of the evidence. She argues that the RPD \u201csimply overemphasized the human rights risk to the general population in Uganda and failed to consider any facts related to the Applicant\u2019s particular situation.\u201d The RPD in fact explicitly considered the documentary evidence relied upon by the Appellant relating to systemic and generalized human rights violations in Uganda, but correctly found that, absent an allegation that the Appellant has had this risk personalized to her in any way, it is insufficient to ground a section 97 claim. I agree with the RPD. I find the Appellant has failed to link this general evidence about country conditions in Uganda to her own circumstances, and the RPD was correct in finding the documentary evidence of systemic and generalized human rights violations in Uganda has not been connected to, or personalized to the Appellant, and therefore is in itself insufficient to ground a section 97 claim. Therefore, I cannot find that the RPD breached procedural fairness by failing to consider the country condition evidence as alleged, or that the RPD failed to consider any relevant facts pertaining to the Appellant, as alleged. CONCLUSION The RAD dismisses the appeal and confirms the decision of the RPD that the Appellant is neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection, pursuant to section 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.", "spans": "[{'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 4048, 'end': 4049}]", "label": "dismissed"}
{"doc_text": " Date: 20200103 Docket: IMM-1444-19 Citation: 2020 FC 10 [UNREVISED CERTIFIED ENGLISH TRANSLATION] Ottawa, Ontario, January 3, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Pentney BETWEEN: YVELINE ISNARDIN JOAO YVENSON SAINT FLEUR Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] The female applicant, Yveline Isnardin, and her minor son, Joao Yvenson Saint Fleur, are seeking judicial review of the decision of the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] upholding the decision of the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] determining that the female applicant is excluded under section 98 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], and Article 1E of the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees on the ground that she had permanent residence in Brazil. [2] The female applicant is a Haitian citizen and her minor son is a citizen of Brazil. In August 2013, the female applicant left Haiti for Brazil where she obtained permanent residence. According to the applicants, she returned to Haiti three years later, on March 19, 2016. According to the respondent, who is relying on immigration forms completed by the female applicant, the female applicant left Brazil on September 21, 2016. [3] The female applicant alleges that in March and May 2016 some men tried to sexually assault her and to kidnap her after she filed a complaint with a justice of the peace. The female applicant, her son and her spouse left Haiti for the United States on May 19, 2016. The female applicant\u2019s spouse was deported, and in July 2017, the female applicant and her son came to Canada, where they filed a claim for refugee protection. [4] On March 1, 2018, there was a hearing before the RPD. Canada\u2019s Minister of Public Safety intervened to establish that the female applicant was a person referred to in Article 1E of the Convention. The RPD rejected the refugee protection claim on March 23, 2018, essentially concluding that the female applicant was referred to in Article 1E of the Convention because she had permanent resident status in Brazil. [5] On February 14, 2019, the RAD upheld the RPD\u2019s decision, concluding that the female applicant was excluded on the ground of her having permanent residence in Brazil at the time of the hearing before the RPD, given that she had not been away from Brazil for over two years. The RAD also concluded that the applicants were not at risk in Brazil. [6] The application for judicial review is challenging that decision. [7] The only issue is the following: is the RAD\u2019s decision that the female applicant had permanent resident status similar to that of Brazilian nationals unreasonable? The standard of review applicable to whether the facts lead to exclusion under Article 1E of the Convention and section 98 of the IRPA is that of reasonableness: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Zeng, 2010 FCA 118 at para 11 [Zeng]. [8] In applying this standard, the Court has to determine whether the decision falls within a range of \u201cpossible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\u201d (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 at para 47 [Dunsmuir]). As long as \u201cthe process and the outcome fit comfortably with the principles of justification, transparency and intelligibility\u201d, this Court cannot substitute its own view of a preferable outcome (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at para 59). [9] The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s recent decision in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov], does not change this conclusion. In the circumstances of the case at bar, and in light of paragraph 144 of Vavilov, it is not necessary to request submissions from the parties on the standard of review and the application of that standard. As in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Canada Post Corp v Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67 at para 24 [Canada Post Corp], \u201cno unfairness arises from\u201d the application of the Vavilov framework in this proceeding \u201cas the applicable standard of review and the result would have been the same under the Dunsmuir framework\u201d. [10] The Supreme Court of Canada also instructs that judicial review is not a line-by-line treasure hunt for error; the decision should be approached as an organic whole: Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, Local 30 v Irving Pulp & Paper, Ltd, 2013 SCC 34 at para 54. Further, a reviewing court must determine whether the decision, viewed as a whole in the context of the record, is reasonable: Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses\u2019 Union v Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board), 2011 SCC 62; Vavilov at para 81; Canada Post Corp at para 30. [11] In the matter at bar, the applicants\u2019 argument is based on the claim that the RAD adopted an unreasonable interpretation of the female applicant\u2019s status in Brazil. The applicants do not dispute the facts; at issue, rather, is the interpretation of the law and policies on permanent residence in Brazil. [12] The RAD mentioned the fact that the female applicant\u2019s passport contains a five-year VIPER visa (special permanent visa and family reunification visa) issued on September 25, 2013, in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and a stamp showing that she has permanent residence, effective November 7, 2013. The RAD rejected the female applicant\u2019s argument that her permanent residence was temporary in nature as she had to renew it every nine years, finding as follows: [19] I do not agree with this interpretation. As per the National Documentation Package on Brazil, permanent residence is indeterminate, even for a foreigner. With respect to the VIPER and its five-year timespan, referred to in Article 18 of Law No. 6,815, respectfully, the appellant is confusing the two documents. The VIPER does not confirm permanent residence; rather, it is the permanent residence stamp itself. Once granted, as is the case here, permanent residence is automatically renewed every nine years without the requirement to reapply. (Citations omitted.) [13] The female applicant submits that this interpretation is unreasonable because the RAD did not consider article 18 of Law No. 6,815, which provides as follows: [translation] Art. 18. The granting of the permanent visa may be conditional, for a period of 5 (five) years at the most, to the exercise of a specific activity and settlement in a given region in the Brazilian territory. [14] The female applicant notes that the RAD\u2019s conclusion on permanent residence is inconsistent with the wording of this provision and with the fact that she stated that she had found neither employment nor housing in Brazil. She submits that, since she has neither employment nor housing in Brazil, she does not have indeterminate permanent resident status, but a temporary status, and that both the RPD\u2019s and the RAD\u2019s findings on this issue are unreasonable. [15] The female applicant alleges that neither the RPD nor the RAD considered her statements at the Canadian border. The notes indicate that she stated that she was a [TRANSLATION] \u201cpermanent resident of Brazil\u201d, but that she also said that she had a [TRANSLATION] \u201ctemporary\u201d status and a [TRANSLATION] \u201ccard for five years\u201d. It is unreasonable not to deal with this evidence. [16] The female applicant notes that in most of the cases of Haitian citizens who came to Canada from Brazil, the respondent produced a list prepared by the Brazilian government, listing the names of Haitians who obtained indeterminate permanent residence in Brazil. There is no such evidence in the matter at bar. This is another sign that the female applicant\u2019s status in Brazil is only temporary. [17] The respondent notes that the RAD\u2019s decision is based on the RAD\u2019s interpretation of the facts, including the information in the National Documentation Package on Brazil regarding permanent residence for individuals who have fled Haiti. The courts have established a framework for determining whether a person fulfills the criteria of Article 1E of the Convention, and the RAD\u2019s analysis follows this framework. The Minister made a prima facie case that the female applicant could have returned to Brazil at the time of the hearing before the RPD. Once this case was made, the burden of proof shifted to the female applicant, who had to establish that she could not in fact enjoy the rights conferred on her by her permanent residence. [18] In the matter at bar, the RAD did not err in relying on the stamps in the female applicant\u2019s passport, which indicate that she obtained a temporary status allowing her to enter Brazil (the VIPER visa) and then permanent residence. The respondent notes that the document in the National Documentation Package on Haiti referred to by the RAD explains this process: [T]o apply for permanent residence Haitians must go to the Federal Police Department before the expiration of their five-year visa. Based on article 18 of Law No. 6,815 . . . , Haitian nationals must prove that they are working and living in Brazil . . . . Sources state that the validity period of the permanent residence is indeterminate, but that permanent residence must be re-issued periodically, currently at nine-year intervals. [R]e-issue of permanent residence is automatic and there is no question of re-application or re-qualification. (Citations omitted.) [19] The respondent submits that the RAD\u2019s analysis is in line with this explanation. The RAD noted the stamps in the female applicant\u2019s passport, and it is not unreasonable for the RAD to give more weight to objective evidence instead of relying on the statement made by the female applicant at the border. The respondent argues that the female applicant did not satisfy the burden of establishing that she was unable to benefit from the rights conferred on her by her permanent residence. [20] Before embarking on its analysis, the Court must note that this is an application for judicial review, and that the standard of reasonableness applies. As explained by the Supreme Court in Canada Post Corp: [28] In Vavilov, this Court held that \u201c[r]easonableness review aims to give effect to the legislature\u2019s intent to leave certain decisions with an administrative body while fulfilling the constitutional role of judicial review to ensure that exercises of state power are subject to the rule of law\u201d (para. 82). The Court affirmed that \u201cit is not enough for the outcome of a decision to be justifiable. Where reasons for a decision are required, the decision must also be justified, by way of those reasons, by the decision maker to those to whom the decision applies\u201d (para. 86 (emphasis in original)). . . . [31 A reasonable decision is \u201cone that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 85). Accordingly, when conducting reasonableness review \u201c[a] reviewing court must begin its inquiry into the reasonableness of a decision by examining the reasons provided with \u2018respectful attention\u2019 and seeking to understand the reasoning process followed by the decision maker to arrive at [the] conclusion\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 84, quoting Dunsmuir, at para. 48). The reasons should be read holistically and contextually in order to understand \u201cthe basis on which a decision was made\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 97, citing Newfoundland Nurses). [32] A reviewing court should consider whether the decision as a whole is reasonable: \u201cwhat is reasonable in a given situation will always depend on the constraints imposed by the legal and factual context of the particular decision under review\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 90). The reviewing court must ask \u201cwhether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 99, citing Dunsmuir, at paras. 47 and 74, and Catalyst Paper Corp. v. North Cowichan (District), 2012 SCC 2, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para. 13). [33] Under reasonableness review, \u201c[t]he burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 100). The challenging party must satisfy the court \u201cthat any shortcomings or flaws relied on . . . are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 100). [21] I am not persuaded by the applicants\u2019 argument in the matter at bar. The RAD considered both the evidence filed by the female applicant and the objective evidence in the National Documentation Package on Haiti. The RPD and the RAD expressly dealt with the female applicant\u2019s argument that her status in Brazil was only temporary. The RAD referred to article 18, but it also noted the objective evidence indicating that \u201cpermanent residence is automatically renewed every nine years without the requirement to reapply\u201d. [22] The reasons for the RAD\u2019s decision are \u201cjustifiable\u201d and provide a transparent and intelligible justification (see Dunsmuir at para 48; Vavilov at paras 81 and 136; Canada Post Corp at paras 28\u201329). The reasons demonstrate that the decision conforms to the relevant legal and factual constraints that bear on the decision maker and the issue at hand (Canada Post Corp at para 30, citing Vavilov at paras 105\u201307). [23] In their written submissions, the applicants refer to Tab 14.11 of the National Documentation Package on Haiti, alleging that the RAD did not take the contents of this document into consideration. At the hearing, I asked for clarification on whether this document was part of the National Documentation Package on the date of the RAD hearing since it is not part of the certified tribunal record filed before the Court by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada in the matter at bar. [24] The applicants are unable to confirm whether the document was before the RAD; however, they confirm that the contents of this document are the same as the contents of Tab 3.7 of the National Documentation Package on Brazil. This document is the same document as the one at Tab 3.12 of the Haiti Package. I note that both the RPD and the RAD referred to Tab 3.12, and it therefore does not seem that the RAD\u2019s decision can be set aside because they did not refer to Tab 14.11 of the Haiti Package. If the contents are the same, there is no need for the RAD to mention both documents. [25] The applicants have not established that the RAD ignored a document or an important fact in its analysis or that it adopted an interpretation that was not in line with the objective evidence: see Zeng at paras 35\u201336. The RAD\u2019s decision falls within a range of \u201cpossible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law\u201d (Dunsmuir, at para 47), and the RAD\u2019s analysis is \u201cinternally coherent and rational [and] is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d (Vavilov, at para 85). There is no reason to set aside the RAD\u2019s decision in the matter at bar. [26] For all of these reasons, the application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question of general importance to certify. JUDGMENT in IMM-1444-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is as follows: The application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question of general importance to certify. \u201cWilliam F. Pentney\u201d Judge Certified true translation This 15th day of January 2020.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TC102228 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW I allow this appeal. Anjana Sharma (Principal Appellant) is a citizen of India. She claims that as she experienced domestic violence in India, she is a Convention refugee. Having reviewed the record, I allow the appeal. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee. BACKGROUND The Appellant bases her claim on the following. The Appellant was born on May 3 1972, and lived in Gurdaspur, India. She was married and had two children. She worked at home as a tailor; customers would go to her home. After she was married, she found out her husband was not faithful. Further, when she was pregnant with her first child, he became physically violent. The Appellant tried to kill herself twice, but the attempts failed. The Appellant\u2019s children went to study in Canada. The Appellant visited Canada in June 2017 to July 2018. She returned to India and stayed with her husband because she did not have any other place to go. Her husband assaulted her and pressed her neck while doing so. The Appellant returned to Canada in August 2018 but had to return in December 2018 because of visa requirements. This time she stayed with her mother. After about one week her husband went to her mother\u2019s house. He assaulted her and pushed her mother. Her mother asked her to not go to the police because it would shame the family. The Appellant returned to Canada in September 2019. Her husband continued to threaten her. He told her he had \u201ccells\u201d, people he knew, in Canada. The Appellant filed for divorce in May 2020. Her children did not talk to her for a period of time, but have since relented. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) found that there was insufficient credible evidence that the Appellant was a Convention refugee and/or a person in need of protection. The Appellant has appealed to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD). In the Appeal Record, the Appellant has included Counsel\u2019s arguments, the Appellant\u2019s arguments, and arguments in the Appellant\u2019s affidavit. I have considered and treated all of them as her submissions upon appeal NEW/LATE EVIDENCE Upon appeal, the Appellant presented photographs, affidavits, translated transcripts of texts and audio recording of phone conversations, and articles upon appeal. All evidence, other than the photographs, are accepted onto the record. According to the law, I can only accept evidence that: arose after the RPD decision; or was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that you could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it (the Raza principles). The Photographs are not accepted onto the record The Appellant has provided five photographs of her in the hospital. The first photograph is dated August 20, 2019. All of these photographs predate the date of rejection. The Appellant argues that she did not tell the RPD about this incident because of mental stress. However, the RPD specifically questioned the Appellant about her mental health and treatment and the Appellant testified about acquiring treatment with the help of her daughter. She did not mention an incident that was so severe that she had to go to the hospital. Further, the decision was not issued until March 10, 2021; this date is the date of rejection. The Appellant had almost two months to submit these pictures to the RPD. The Appellant has the burden of proof and has not shown that the photos were not reasonably available at the time of the rejection. Further, she has not shown that she could not reasonably have been expected to provide the photos to RPD prior to the decision. There is not evidence of a barrier to her ability to do so. For these reasons, the photographs do not meet the criteria of section 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Medical Report is accepted onto the record The Appellant has provided a medical report stating that she has started medication for her depression on January 3, 2021. Her depression affects her memory. The medical report meets the requirements of IRPA and the Raza principles. Given that the doctor stated that the Appellant had started her medication in January 2021, it is clear that this medical report was written after the date of rejection. While there is not letterhead on this document, it is stamped. I find the sources and the circumstances of the documentary sufficiently credible for the purposes of admissibility. Further, the evidence is new as it relates to events that occurred after the date of rejection. It is relevant, as the Appellant\u2019s mental health is an issue, albeit not a very large issue, in this appeal. This document is accepted onto the record. The Appellant\u2019s Affidavit is accepted onto the record The Appellant has provided an affidavit dated June 10, 2021, on to the record. In it, she discusses the hearing and states that she did not have time to have the audio of the conversations transcribed before the hearing. This affidavit contains arguments that include discussions of the RPD\u2019s conduct during the hearing. I find that it is not reasonable to expect her to have provided this evidence prior to the date of rejection. Further, the evidence is new, credible, and relevant. I have accepted it onto the record. The Mother\u2019s Affidavit is accepted onto the record The Appellant has provided an affidavit from her mother dated June 7, 2021. She describes the events that befell the Appellant, including that she did not allow the Appellant to report the matter. She describes the police as very corrupt. In this appeal, I accept that the Appellant could not have anticipated that the RPD would not accept the credibility of the account of the beating and, in particular, that the mother would have stopped the Appellant from reporting it. It is not reasonable to expect the Appellant to have submitted the affidavit before the date of rejection. Further, it is relevant, new in that it is evidence from the mother, and is credible. The documents are accepted onto the record. Text Messages/Transcripts of recordings The Appellant has submitted transcripts of text messages with her children and of audio recordings of conversations with her husband and her children. She also provided an Official Certified Translation Affidavit dated May 16, 2021. These conversations predate the date of rejection. In her affidavit of June 10, 2021, she wrote that she did not have time to have the audio transcribed. I note that the Appellant had submitted the audio recordings on a USB stick on January 12, 2021, the day before the hearing. I accept that this was done right before the hearing, and it is likely that the Appellant did not have time to have the recordings transcribed. It was in the purview of the RPD\u2019s authority to give the Appellant time to have the recordings transcribed and it did not do so in spite of the fact that the decision was not written until almost two months after the hearing. I find that these transcriptions have met the requirements of section 110 (4) of the IRPA as it was not reasonable to expect the Appellant to have submitted them before the date of rejection. The evidence is new as it transmits the information that the audio recordings attempted to. It is relevant and I find that the source and the circumstances are sufficiently credible for the purposes of admissibility. The transcription of the audio recording is accepted onto the record. Also, the text messages relate to a conversation that occurred after that date of rejection. I find that these transcriptions have met the requirements of section 110 (4) of the IRPA. Further, the evidence is new as it relates to her relationship with her children, it is relevant as it expresses the family dynamic as impacted by the domestic issues, and it is credible. Article not accepted onto the record The Appellant submitted an article dated May 13, 2021, entitled \u201cPunjab: cop tries to molest widow, villagers nab him red-handed\u201d from the Pressbolt news website. While this is evidence of police corruption, I find that it is not sufficiently relevant to the appeal to accept onto the record. Late Evidence: Audio Recordings not accepted onto the record The appeal was perfected on June 14, 2021. On June 15 after appeal perfected, the Appellant provided four audio recordings. She did not provide an application in accordance with Rules 29 and 37 of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules (RAD Rules). The audio recordings are not accepted onto the record. In any event, the transcripts are accepted onto the record and the Appellant is not prejudiced by the audio recording not being placed on the record. ORAL HEARING The Appellant has requested an oral hearing. However, I do not find that the medical report, the affidavits, and the transcripts raise a serious credibility issue. For these reasons, the RAD will not hold a hearing. ANALYSIS I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence and arguments. This review includes listening to the entire recording of the hearing. This recording is on record. In adjudicating, this appeal, I have considered the Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (the Gender Guidelines). The evidence is sufficiently credible and consistent on central points I find that there is sufficient credible and consistent evidence to support the central elements of the claim. The Appellant has been consistent about the events regarding her husband attacking her. She stated that it started when she was pregnant, which is not uncommon. She consistently reported that she tried to kill herself on two occasions. Her Basis of Claim (BOC) and her testimony are consistent about the dates that she returned to Pakistan. She stated that she stayed with her husband in the February of 2018. On that occasion, he attacked her which included pressing her neck in February 2018. She has been consistent about returning and staying with her mother in July 2018. Her evidence regarding her husband showing up and assaulting her is consistent. Further, the evidence that her mother did not want the Appellant to go to police, is also consistent with the mother\u2019s affidavit. Medical reports are not necessary to establish spousal abuse The RPD took a negative inference from the lack of medical reports. However, it is not necessary for a person to be beaten to the point of requiring hospitalization for abuse to exist. Granted, corroborative evidence is helpful when there are flaws in the evidence. However, many of the flaws identified by the RPD relate to issues that are peripheral to the central issue. I find that the lack of medical documentation does not weigh against the Appellant\u2019s credibility. Returning to India and to the husband The Appellant returned to India on at least two occasions in 2018. She stated that it was because of Visa requirements. The RPD found that it was not reasonable that the Appellant would fear her husband and that she would have returned to him in 2018. It took a negative inference when the Appellant had \u201cgone back to an abusive relationship once again in August 2018\u201d and found there was a lack of subject fear. The Appellant testified that she did not have anywhere else to stay. The RPD\u2019s reasoning shows several errors. In August, the Appellant did not \u201cgo back to an abusive relationship\u201d; rather she stayed with her mother. Further, it is consistent with the pattern of abuse for an abused woman to return to the aggressor. To conclude that the abuse could not have occurred because the Principal Appellant returned to him when she could have left him is to follow the mythology about domestic violence. The cyclical nature of abuse, the psychological barriers to leaving, are well-documented. The barriers to leave in a patriarchal culture where women are financially, socially, and professionally disempowered are even more pronounced. It is not a reason to find that there is a credibility issue with the account of abuse or that there is a lack of subjective fear. Similarly, while the Appellant did delay in requesting protection, this too is not an indication of a lack of credibility and/or subjective fear in a culture where one does not discuss or report domestic violence. The cultural influences are further discussed later in this decision. As will be noted, there is sufficient objective evidence to conclude that the Appellant would not have likely left her husband and reported the abuse given her background. This, in addition to the cyclical nature of domestic violence, provides sufficient reason to find that the fact that the Appellant did return to live with him during one visit to India and did not report the abuse is, in this appeal, not evidence that weighs against the likelihood that the abuse occurred. The Minister\u2019s evidence of Facebook photos The Minister did not attend the hearing, but did intervene on the grounds of credibility. He provided photographs from the husband\u2019s and the son\u2019s Facebook accounts. The RPD repeatedly questioned the Appellant about \u201cselfies\u201d, the inference being that she could not be a battered wife if she took selfies. This demonstrates a lack of understanding regarding the cyclical nature of abuse. As noted by the Supreme Court of Canada, the relationship often goes through periods where there is an absence of abuse before the abuse reoccurs. This is one of the reasons that people have difficulties leaving their partners and delay in seeking protection. The existence of some photographs is not evidence that the abuse did not occur. Further, the photographs are located on the Facebook accounts of the Appellant\u2019s son and husband; there is not evidence that they are located on the Appellant\u2019s Facebook account. Having observed the photographs, I do not find that she looks happy in many of them. Further, I accept the Appellant\u2019s testimony that she took the photographs to keep her family, including her children, happy. The RPD noted that the photographs are dated 2017; the Appellant maintains that they were taken years before then. It is plausible that they were posted in 2017, and taken earlier. In any event, even if they were taken in 2017, it is before the Appellant\u2019s consistent evidence that she effectively left her husband in 2018 and divorced him in 2020. I do not take a negative inference from the existence of these photographs. Discrepancies in the evidence A significant amount of time at the hearing was spent on peripheral issues such as the identification of the Appellant\u2019s brother in the Visa applications documents although the Appellant provided a statement before the hearing stating she found out the information about her brother was incorrect. In other words, the Appellant had already explained the discrepancy. Similarly, the RPD commented that the date of the marriage was different \u201ceverywhere\u201d. However, the only discrepancy is that it states that the Appellant was married in 1998 in the Visa application, which the Appellant testified that the husband had filled in. Further, the RPD stated that the BOC noted that it was set as March 3, 1991. However, counsel had completed the BOC and the narrative states that the date is March 3, 1991, the date that the Appellant maintained it was. It may be that the Appellant did not have a marriage certificate, however, the Appellant stated that they were not available at that time. I do not take a negative inference from a lack of a marriage certificate; rather, the photographs show that she was in a relationship with a man and had children. There is an excessive focus on minor flaws in the BOC. As an example, the RPD questioned the Appellant on why she did not update the BOC to state that her brother had died; this is at best peripheral, relevance. The relevance on the Appellant\u2019s credibility is lessened by counsel\u2019s previous comment that she had filled in the BOC. Clearly, the Appellant was relying on counsel for paperwork. Similarly, the RPD was critical of the fact that the BOC was missing the Appellant\u2019s name, when it was counsel who had completed it. The RPD also noted that the Appellant could have checked off the box for cruelty on her divorce papers and did not. The Appellant pointed out that they had been separated for two years and her children did not want her to get a divorce. It is entirely plausible that the Appellant had more than one ground to divorce her husband and chose the ground that would cause the least grief to her children. There are other minor discrepancies in the evidence. As an example, in her BOC, the Appellant stated that she went to her son\u2019s Convocation; at the hearing the Appellant testified that she went to the Convocation. However, this is a minor discrepancy and I do not take negative inference in her credibility because of it. Evidence of Audio Recordings of Arguments The Appellant provided a USB with a recording of telephone conversations in Punjabi the day before the hearing. She stated that they showed her husband threatening her. This evidence was not allowed onto the record. While the RPD stated that recordings are not accepted as evidence, and it would not permit the Appellant to play the messages on her phone at the hearing, in fact the RPD has the discretion to allow different forms of evidence, such as recordings, onto the record. An interpreter was present and could have translated the conversation. The USB itself was in Punjabi, and the Appellant should have provided a transcript in English to the tribunal. However, given the tone of the discussion, it is not surprising that counsel did not request the opportunity to submit a transcript after the hearing. Transcripts of the audio recording have now been accepted onto the record. They show arguments between people that the Appellant states is herself and her husband. There are threats as well. I find that they provide corroborative evidence of the Appellant\u2019s claim that she was in an abusive relationship The Appellant was not literally a prisoner The Appellant wrote in her BOC that she was treated like a prisoner. She may not have literally been a prisoner; however, this should not be used as a factor to weigh against her credibility. The RPD questioned her repeatedly about being a prisoner, such as when discussing the photos or that the Appellant worked. I find that it is more likely than not that the Appellant did not mean it literally. The language of the statement is that she was treated \u201clike\u201d a prisoner, not that she was literally one. I do not find that there is a significant inconsistency in being restricted in her movements and activities such as joining her husband on a vacation and running a business from her home. At the very least, the Appellant is entitled to express how she felt about the relationship, and clearly she felt like a prisoner Further, it is plausible that her husband would allow her to work at home, go on some outings, but also restrict her movement in a manner that made her feel like a prisoner. I do not take a negative inference from the Appellant\u2019s statement that she was treated like a prisoner. The Objective Documentary Evidence supports the Appellant The likelihood that the Appellant experienced spousal abuse is consistent with the objective documentation on record. Violence against women is described as \u201cprevalent\u201d and underreported in India. In 2017, in a survey of married women aged from 15 to 49, 83% report domestic violence. Violence against women is worse in the north, where the Punjab is located, as is it widespread and \u201cwidely tolerated by the state\u201d. Woman are abused in Pakistan. Violence against women is described as acute, endemic, and prevalent. The majority of crime in India is against women; and the majority of crime against women is domestic violence. The Appellant\u2019s allegation of domestic violence is consistent with the objective evidence showing widespread abuse of women. It supports a finding that it is more likely than not that the events described by the Appellant occurred. Psychological Condition not established The Appellant\u2019s testimony was not fulsome, at times she answered that she could not remember or that she did not know. The Appellant has alluded to mental health issues; however, there is insufficient evidence to make a determination regarding the impact that it would have on her. This is because there is not sufficient evidence regarding diagnosis and the treatment of any mental health condition. At the hearing, she testified that her daughter took her for treatment in India and that she had been taking medication but stopped while in Canada. Upon appeal, she provided a report from her family doctor that stated she was suffering from depression and had started medication. I accept that this is an authentic medical report. However, considering that it is undated, that there is a typographical error in the spelling of the month of March, and that the doctor does not even identify which medication she is taking, I question the level of care and accuracy that went into this report. Unfortunately, the Appellant has not provided evidence on ongoing treatment for a mental health condition. There is some evidence of some psychological issues, and the tone of questioning may have impacted the Appellant\u2019s ability to participate in the hearing. However, there is insufficient evidence to determine the nature and extent of her condition as well as how it affected her in this claim. The RPD Hearing I find that the tone of the hearing would likely have impacted the Appellant\u2019s ability to testify in a fulsome manner. At times the RPD\u2019s tone during questioning gave the impression it was incredulous and critical. As an example, it is clear from the recording that the RPD was skeptical about the Appellant\u2019s failure to seek police protection. The Appellant testified that her mother did not want her to do so. This is supported by the mother\u2019s affidavit. Nonetheless, the RPD asked the Appellant\u2019s age, and the RPD noted that she would have been 46 years old at the time of the incident. The RPD then stated, as a question, that the Appellant could not go to the police. The inference is that the Appellant was an adult and did not have to listen to her mother. It was an approach that belittles the Appellant. It also shows a lack of insight into battered woman syndrome which includes a reluctance to report abuse, especially if a woman feels unsupported by family. Similarly, when the RPD asked the Appellant about not calling the Canadian police, her tone sounded incredulous. Questions were, at times, unclear. As an example, at one point it was unclear if the RPD was questioning the Appellant about the last call she had from her husband or about a conversation where the Appellant discussed divorce with the husband. In short, it was confusing. The Appellant\u2019s testimony that her daughter left to go to Winnipeg and then went to see her father in India was consistent, but the RPD\u2019s question seems to indicate that it was not clear. The RPD admonished counsel for not asking relevant questions and retraumatizing the Appellant when counsel questioned her about a conversation with her daughter. Counsel was asking questions about the recording that the RPD would not let into evidence. I find that these were relevant questions. The Appellant was arguing that the family\u2019s lack of support was why the Appellant did not seek a divorce earlier and did not seek protection. In terms of traumatizing the Appellant, it sounded like the Appellant was already in tears before counsel began her questions. I find that the RPD\u2019s tone would have an impact on the Appellant, a tone which, at times, bordered on sarcasm. It was proper for the RPD to point out that counsel should not point at things when the Appellant is testifying. However, in terms of the questioning about the daughter, I find that it is more likely that a significant portion of the Appellant\u2019s distress was due to the tone of the RPD\u2019s previous questioning. Further, while the RPD stated in its decision that there were several breaks during the hearing, the first and only break was taken at 1:51:56, almost 2 hours into the hearing, when there was a 10-minute break. Summary The RPD erred when it did not discern and weigh the evidence that was credible from the evidence that was not credible. Certainly, while some aspects of the claim are not consistent, there is sufficient credible and consistent evidence that the Appellant experienced physical abuse. The evidence on the central issues is internally consistent in that the BOC, the testimony, and the documentary evidence are consistent. The weight of the evidence leads to the conclusion that the Appellant was subjected to domestic violence. State protection The Appellant has argued that the women who face abuse in India are unable to seek legal or judicial help. I am cognizant of the Federal Court\u2019s recent decision in Alazar which indicates that the Minister has procedural fairness rights before the RAD, even if the Minister has not intervened in an appeal. I note that, in addition the Appellant has argued that the agent of persecution has connections, and her family did not want her to do so. The Minister received a copy of the Appellant\u2019s Record, as required by the RAD Rules, and therefore received notice that state protection was an issue on appeal. Accordingly, I find that the Minister does not require additional notice that the RAD is considering the issue of state protection on appeal, and the Minister\u2019s procedural fairness rights are not breached. The Appellant argues that she could not reach out to the police for protection because her children and her mother did not want her to do so. This is supported by her mother\u2019s affidavit. The Appellant\u2019s reluctance to involve the police is consistent with the objective evidence that there is \u201ctremendous pressure on women to bear abuse in silence\u201d, that families who report abuse are ostracized, and there is fear of marginalization, exclusion, or stigmatization. The majority of women, 77%, do not seek help or have not told anyone about the violence. There are issues with \u201cdeeply entrenched patriarchal attitudes of police officers, judicial officers and other relevant civil servants\u201d, leading to women not reporting or testifying, and withdrawing complaints. The Appellant is from a culture where it is common to not report abuse for fear of ostracization. I find that it is objectively unreasonable for her to have sought police protection. This finding is in keeping with the Gender Guidelines\u2019 discussion of state protection. The Appellant states that she fears the police because her husband has connections with the police. I note that the RPD dismisses the Appellant\u2019s testimony that he has a connection with the police at the same time as it acknowledges that he had drinks with them at times. This does not make sense. If he has drinks with them, he has a connection. In any event, even if he did not, the objective evidence leads to the conclusion that it is unlikely that the Appellant would be afforded sufficient protection While there is a Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, enforcement is poor or uneven. Sources agree that women are not adequately protected against domestic violence. The police are known to be inefficient and not effective. Convictions are rare. Further, while the Appellant did not report threats in Canada to the police, she has come from a culture of silence about domestic violence. There were other obstacles. She was not supported by her family and had a basic understanding of English. Even though she may have had a lawyer helping her with the divorce and the claim, I find that in this case it is consistent with her background that she did not report this to the police. Further, the Appellant\u2019s behaviour in Canada has limited relevance as the issue relates to a forward-looking risk in Pakistan. For these reasons, the police in India are not likely to assist women who are subjected to domestic violence. The Appellant feared her ex-husband\u2019s connections with the police. She came from a culture of silence. I find that there is not likely adequate state protection for this Appellant in her circumstances. Internal Flight Alternative (IFA) The RPD raised the possibility of an IFA in Amritsar. The Appellant has argued that she would not have an IFA there. The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Rasaratnam. The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA. Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there. Both prongs must be satisfied to find that an Appellant has an IFA. Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with an Appellant to show that he/she does not have an IFA. The finding of an IFA must be based on a distinct evaluation of the region for that purpose taking into account an Appellant\u2019s personal circumstances. An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option. An Appellant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or undergo undue hardship in traveling there and staying there. The hardship associated with relocation is not the kind of undue hardship that renders an IFA unreasonable. The standard is high and requires proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant in travelling to and in living in the IFA location. The Appellant clearly argued she would not have a viable IFA in her memorandum. Again, the Minister received a copy of the Appellant\u2019s Record, as required by the RAD Rules and therefore received notice that state protection was a live issue on appeal. Accordingly, I find that the Minister does not require additional notice that the RAD is considering the issue of an internal flight alternative on appeal, and the Minister\u2019s procedural fairness rights are not breached. There is a serious possibility of persecution in India for the Appellant The Appellant argues that the husband works for the government and can find her. Further, his brother works for the police and would have connections to find her. In small cities in the Punjab, it is easy to find people. The Punjab is not a large area, and Mudhal and Amritsar are both located there. For this Appellant, and in her circumstances, I find that there is a serious possibility of persecution in Amritsar. However, even if this is incorrect, I find that it is unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate in India. It is unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate in India? In my assessment of whether the Appellant would face undue hardship if relocating and living in India, I have considered cultural and economic matters in accordance with the Gender Guidelines. Accommodation I think that it is likely that the Appellant would face undue hardship as she is not likely to find accommodation in India. The objective evidence supports this conclusion. As a single woman, the Appellant would be asked details of her father\u2019s or husband\u2019s name to access accommodation and services, this is an additional barrier to acquiring them. Single women face difficulties access housing. Women are expected to live with their father or spouse, and no one wants to rent to them. Information about state hostels for women are varied, and they do not appear to be available throughout India. The objective evidence supports a conclusion that housing is not available to single women and that the Appellant would face considerable difficulty finding a place to live. Employment The Appellant is 49 years old. She has a working permit certificate. She has only worked in a alteration shop run in her home where she tailors custom designed women\u2019s dresses. According to the objective evidence, employment prospects are improving in India, but not for women; women find themselves in precarious jobs requiring low skills which offer low and unequal wages. In the Punjab, only 16 to 18 percent of woman are employed. Women earn about 34.5 percent less then men. It is difficult for single woman to acquire financial support to start a business; only women who are skilled may break the mold and find employment. Given the Appellant\u2019s attributes and the objective evidence, I find it is not likely that the Appellant would be able to find work. Rather, I find, trying to find employment would constitute undue hardship for this Appellant in her circumstances. Health care Healthcare is a significant issue for women in India. Two-thirds of women have issues acquiring healthcare. Culture As a single woman, it is likely that the Appellant would face significant barriers. There is significant discrimination against women. This discrimination is worse in the north, where the Punjab is located, from their family for issues such as food and sanitation. The Appellant testified at the hearing that she did not know anyone in Amritsar, she would not survive, and that her family would not talk to her because of the divorce. It is unlikely that she would acquire the support she would need to relocate and live in Amritsar or anywhere in India. There is a deep-rooted preference for sons leading to gender inequality. Single women have to depend on people to provide for them. The cultural issues the Appellant would have to face if she were to relocate and live in India constitute undue hardship. There is Undue hardship throughout India While more pronounced in the north, I find that these issues are likely to be prevalent throughout India. It is likely that she would face undue hardship should she have to relocate and live anywhere throughout all of India. That it is unreasonable for the Appellant to relocate and live in India, is sufficient to find that she does not have an IFA. Summary Parts of the Appellant\u2019s evidence may be exaggerated, but I find it is sufficiently credible evidence to find that the Appellant is a Convention refugee. There is a significant amount of information available in the National Documentation Package that supports the Appellant\u2019s claim. It was an error to ignore this evidence. That the Appellant used terms like prisoner, when she was not literally a prisoner, is not sufficient to find that the abuse did not happen. Photographs of some happy times are not sufficient to find that there were not unhappy times. It is not necessary to have medical reports to establish that there was domestic violence. Further, effective state protection is not available and the Appellant does not have an IFA. CONCLUSION The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.", "spans": "[{'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 6664, 'end': 6665}]", "label": "accepted"}
{"doc_text": " 20200109 Docket: IMM-1717-19 Citation: 2020 FC 16 Ottawa, Ontario, January 9, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Annis BETWEEN: CAROLINA GARCIA GARCIA SALOME SUAZA GARCIA JUAN MIGUEL SUAZA MACHADO Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Introduction [1] Carolina Garcia Garcia [the Principal Applicant], her common-law spouse [the male Applicant] and her younger daughter [together with the Principal Applicant and the male Applicant, the Applicants] are applying for judicial review pursuant to section 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, LC 2001, c 27 [IRPA]. This application concerns a decision made by the Refugee Protection Division [the RPD], dated February 18, 2019, rejecting the Applicants\u2019 refugee claims because of insufficient credible and trustworthy evidence. [2] For the reasons that follow, the application is dismissed. II. Facts [3] The Applicants are citizens of Colombia. The Principal Applicant is 39 years old, has about twelve years of education, is a high school graduate, and worked for over ten years in Colombia in hospital administration at Cartago Hospital. The Male Applicant is a 45-year-old jeweller from Cartago, with a grade 8 of education. [4] The Principal Applicant alleges that the \u201cLos Rastrojos Group\u201d, a Colombian drug trafficking paramilitary organization, assassinated her former husband, Luis Alfonso Betancourt Lopez, in December 2001. At that time, she alleges that the group declared her a Military Objective. [5] On January 2, 2002, she was abducted in Cartago together with her other daughter, Juanita Betancourt Lopez, then ten months old. Her kidnappers blindfolded her, beat her, and verbally abused the Principal Applicant. They said they have killed her husband and ordered her to change the name of the daughter, and remove her own name from the daughter\u2019s birth certificate. The kidnappers forced the Principal Applicant to comply, and arranged with an aunt to register the child as the aunt\u2019s offspring, under a different name. [6] The Principal Applicant then left Cartago for Cali where she lived for six years. She met her current common-law partner, the male Applicant, after her return to Cartago in 2007. Their daughter, Salome, was born in 2014. They lived in an uneventful life until 2016. [7] In November 2016, the Principal Applicant received several telephone phone calls demanding that money should be paid to the Rastrojos. In addition, the Rastrojos distributed pamphlets in the area, including the Applicants\u2019 home, demanding \u201cmoney for protection\u201d. The Principal Applicant received telephone calls identifying her by name, in which the caller also insulted her and asked why she had returned in the area with her daughter. The Principal Applicant filed a police complaint in Cartago. The police accepted the complaint but verbally advised her to comply with the demand of Los Rastrojos. [8] The Applicants decided to leave Colombia due to the stress; they felt that their lives were in danger. They already had passports, so they applied for and obtained United States visas in August 2017. The Principal Applicant also tried, without success, to obtain a US visa for her older daughter, Juanita. In January 2018, the demands from the Rastrojos increased and the telephone calls became more threatening. They had discovered that the Principal Applicant had applied for and obtained passport for her older daughter, Juanita, using her original name. The Rastrojos warned the Principal Applicant that because she had not complied with their order from 2002, she had now become \u201cMilitary Objective\u201d again, and had been sentenced to \u201ccapital punishment\u201d. [9] The Principal Applicant went to file a complaint again with the police, but was informally told that there was not much the police could do so she should protect herself. The Applicants arranged to leave Colombia on February 6, 2018, and went to the USA. They now seek Canada\u2019s protection [10] The RPD noted that the Principal Applicant\u2019s mother, sister, and two brothers were already living in Canada when she arrived here to make a refugee claim. I. Issues [11] The Applicants submit that this case raises the following issues: Did the RPD err in assessing the Principal Applicant\u2019s credibility? Did the RPD err in its application of section 97 of the IRPA? II. Standard of Review [12] By the revised principles in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] S.C.J. No. 65 at para. 26 [Vavilov], reasonableness is presumed to be the applicable standard of review for all aspects of the decision. None of the exceptions described in Vavilov would affect the presumption that the reasonableness standard should apply in this matter. [13] The reviewing court no longer attempts to ascertain the \"range\" of possible reasonable conclusions that would have been open to the decision maker (Vavilov, para 83). Instead, a reasonable decision is one that is based on a reading that is both rational and logical and justified in light of the legal and factual constraints that bear on the decision. [14] Regarding the first factor, the reasoning must be both rational and logical, allowing the reviewing court to trace the decision maker\u2019s reasoning without encountering any fatal flaws in its overarching logic and following a line of analysis that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the conclusion at which it arrived, (Vavilov, para 102). In addition, \u201cit is not enough for the outcome of a decision to be justifiable... the decision must also be justified\u201d (Vavilov, para 86). [15] In the second instance, a reasonable decision is justified in light of the particular legal and factual constraints that bear on the decision. It is not possible to catalog all of the legal and factual considerations that could constrain an administrative decision-maker in a particular case. [16] With respect to the constraints on factual findings, which extends to inferences of fact, applicants must demonstrate that exceptional circumstances apply which would permit the reviewing court to interfere with factual findings, and that they are not requesting the court to re-weigh and reassess the evidence considered by the decision-maker: Vavilov, para 125, Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 SCC 31, [2018] 2 S.C.R. 230, at para. 55; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 (CanLII), [2009] 1 SCR 339 at para. 64; Dr. Q. v College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, 2003 SCC 19 (CanLII), [2003] 1 SCR 226, at paras. 41-42. [17] Otherwise, the applicant must demonstrate that the decision is not justified in light of the facts based on the evidence that was actually before the decision-maker. This would include where the decision maker has not taken the evidentiary record and the general factual matrix that bears on its decision into account. Examples include where there is a flawed logical process by which the fact is drawn from the evidence, or where the decision maker has fundamentally misapprehended or failed to account for the relevant evidence, or made a finding that was contrary to the overwhelming weight of the evidence, nevertheless while respecting the relative advantage enjoyed by the decision-maker who heard the viva voce evidence for questions of credibility, which are quintessentially findings of fact: Vavilov at para. 126; Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 (CanLII), [2008] 1 SCR 190, at para. 47; Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at para. 48; Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v Southam Inc., 1997 CanLII 385 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 748, at para. 56. [18] The particular constraint at issue in this matter pertains to the evidence before the RPD and its fact-findings, including those relating to credibility. III. Analysis [19] Lacks of credibility findings by the RPD included the following: The Principal Applicant\u2019s mother, sister and two brothers were sponsored and were already living in Canada when she arrived here, but her mother was unable to sponsor her because she was too old; the Principal Applicant\u2019s failure to mention that she had been refused a United States visitor visa in 2007 and her misleading explanation; the Principal Applicant\u2019s failure to mention the initial rejected claims for her sister and family in Canada in her Basis of Claims [BOC] and misleading explanation; the reavailment of male Applicant to the country of persecution and his failure to make asylum claims in Panama during his trip there between February and March 2017, which provided reasons to doubt the Applicants\u2019 truthfulness; given that counsel represented the Applicants, there was a lack of corroborating documents from the aunt to allegations concerning the daughter\u2019s name change, in addition to unsatisfactory explanations from the Principal Applicant that she did not know that a letter of corroboration would be necessary; the presence of the Principal Applicant\u2019s father in Cartago was inconsistent, including stating that she had no knowledge of problems experienced by him from the Rastrojos, even though present when she received threatening phone calls and where the country condition documentation states that any threat to a victim also extends to their family; evasive answers regarding the presence of witnesses during threatening phone calls, as she did not consider her direct family as admissible witnesses; the lack of consistency between the two police reports and the presence of witnesses and lack of consistency in testifying evidence regarding whether or not other individuals were present during threatening phone calls; stating in the first complaint to the police that she used to have a tranquil life with her family until this group appeared without referring to the earlier murder episode of her first husband by the same group; inconsistent evidence between the Principal Applicant\u2019s oral testimony, the written narrative and the BOC regarding the moment that she was threatened she would be killed. When asked to explain the discrepancy, she was evasive and failed to explain; inconsistent evidence in the Principal Applicant\u2019s second complaint to police regarding the motive of Los Rastrojos to threaten her and her family with death in January 2018, when in the January 2018 complaint to police documents her complaint was that Los Rastrojos were angered because they learned that the Principal Applicant and her daughter had returned to Cartago; similar inconsistencies in her oral testimony and the BOC Narrative that Los Rastrojos were furious because they found out that the Principal Applicant and her first daughter, Juanita, had obtained a passport for Juanita bearing her real name, contrary to the order they had given the Principal Applicant back in 2002, to effectively erase her first husband\u2019s name; that the second police report and the witness statements as allegedly filed on or about January 17, 2018, were filed as the Applicants were purchasing their air tickets to leave Canada. Consequently, the RPD also found and determined, on a balance of probabilities, that these and other inconsistencies illustrate that the Principal Applicant went to police for the sole reason of corroborating her subsequent refugee claim, and not actually to seek state protection; adverse credibility inferences from the police reports and witness statements given the inconsistencies whether relocation in Colombia was sufficient for the Los Rastrojos and the lack of credible evidence regarding any witnesses to the events; her repeated error as to the year the Principal Applicant had been threatened; indications of memorization of sections of the BOC, including typographical errors as to given dates, and reference to being declared \u201cMilitary Objective\u201d, an explanation for the term when a term of art used in Response to Information Request with little or no understanding of its import, which did not reflect any personal experience on her part was used to embellish or exaggerate the claim; and reference to capital punishment on two occasions when the dates were wrong without inability to provide an explanation. [20] The RPD concluded that the Applicants did not have a forward facing risk on a balance of probabilities because they failed to produce sufficient credible and trustworthy evidence to prove their claims that the Los Rastrojos Group were interested in exhorting or harming them, while the Applicants\u2019 father has not been threatened or harmed in Colombia in their absence. [21] In addition, the country condition evidence from 2017 indicated that the presence of Los Rastrojos is less significant than in previous years and they are on track to disappear. [22] The Applicants are requesting that the Court reweigh the evidence when there is no basis to do so and there is more than sufficient evidence supporting a finding of facts of a lack credibility on the part of the Principal Applicant and her husband. [23] Recourse to the decisions of Maldonado v MEI, 2 FC 302 (CA) or Valtchev v Canada (MCI), 2001 FCT 776, regarding the acceptance of the Applicant\u2019s sworn testimony and avoiding adverse implausibility credibility findings, would have no application in the face of the serious lack of credibility of the adult Applicants. That is without regard to decisions of this Court, indicating that Rule 11 of the RPD rules requires corroboration. Maldonado does not eliminate the need for producing trustworthy evidence, or that the rule in Valtchev is no longer considered good law: (Kallab, para 158) [24] The Applicants allege that even if Los Rastrojos is a criminal gang, the RPD did not dispute the fact that the Principal Applicant fears a vendetta by Los Rastrojos. I disagree. The evidence of the Member is quite clear that \u201con a balance of probabilities that the claimants would not be troubled by them [Los Rastrojos] if they return to Columbia.\u201d IV. Conclusion [25] The Court concludes that the decision is reasonable being justified based both on its internally coherent transparent and intelligible reasoning and in light of the legal and factual constraints that bear on the decision. Accordingly, the application is dismissed with no questions certified for appeal. JUDGMENT in IMM-1717-19 The application is dismissed. There are no questions certified for appeal.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : MC001798 MC001799 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Amendment - Amendement Amended Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision Amend\u00e9s AMENDED REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Ouigi Sansaricq and Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent (Respondents) are citizens of Haiti. The Minister (Appellant) is appealing the positive decision rendered in Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent\u2019s claim by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) on January 6, 2020. The positive decision rendered in Ouigi Sansaricq\u2019s claim has not been appealed. The RPD found that the Respondents were Convention refugees under s 96 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in granting Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent asylum, specifically in its finding that she was not excluded under s 98 of IRPA and 1E of the Convention. The Appellant argues that she held a status substantially similar to that of nationals in Brazil on the date of the RPD hearing, and that even if she had lost that status, she was able to reacquire it. The Appellant submits that the RPD decision regarding Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent should be set aside and her claim for asylum rejected. The Respondents reply that the RPD did not err in its findings, submitting that it correctly analyzed the objective documentary evidence regarding the loss of status in Brazil after an absence of two years, and the inability to regain it in the particular situation of Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent. I conclude that the RPD did not err in its finding that Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent was not excluded under 1E of the Convention. After applying the factors of the Zeng v. Canada analysis to the testimonial and documentary evidence, with careful consideration of the Appellant\u2019s submissions and the Respondent\u2019s reply, I find that the RPD reached the correct finding. I confirm the RPD decision regarding the Respondents. In particular, I confirm the finding of the RPD that Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent faces the serious possibility of persecution in Haiti based on the Convention ground of her imputed political opinion, that she is credible regarding her allegations of the threats and attacks against her in Haiti, that she has established subjective fear that is objectively well-founded and forward-facing, that she has rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Haiti and that there is no internal flight alternative (IFA) in Haiti that would be safe and reasonable for her. DECISION The appeal is dismissed. The RPD decision is maintained. NEW EVIDENCE No new evidence has been provided to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) and there has been no request for an oral hearing. ROLE OF THE RAD When reviewing the RPD decision, I independently assessed the evidence, including listening to the audio recording of the RPD hearing of December 10, 2019, to determine whether or not the RPD was correct in relation to each alleged error of law, of fact, or of mixed law and fact. ANALYSIS\u2014EXCLUSION FOR STATUS IN BRAZIL The RPD found that the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent was not excluded for her permanent resident status in Brazil, as on the date of the hearing, she no longer had that status and the RPD found that she would not be able to regain that status. When considering the various factors of her situation in accordance with Zeng, the RPD concluded that she would not be excluded under sections 1E of the Convention or 98 of IRPA. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred in its findings regarding the exclusion of the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent, specifically that she had not proven that she had lost her status on the day of the hearing, and that even if she had lost her status, had not proven that she could not regain that status. The Appellant therefore submit that she should be excluded. The Respondents reply that the RPD was correct in its findings, as the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent provided testimonial and documentary evidence that she had lost her permanent resident status in Brazil and that she would not be able to regain that status. As established by the Federal Court of Appeal in Zeng, the test to be applied is: Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts. Status in Brazil on the date of the hearing The RPD found that on the day of the hearing, December 10, 2019, the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent no longer had permanent resident status in Brazil, as she had left Brazil in January 2017 and the objective documentary evidence indicated that an absence of more than two years from Brazil would lead to a loss of permanent resident status. The Appellant argues that the RPD erred because the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent failed to provide proof that she had lost her status on the day of the hearing. The Appellant argues that she had not demonstrated that her status had been lost or revoked after this status was established prima facie by the permanent resident card issued by Brazil that states it is valid until December 2022. The Appellant submits that she should therefore be excluded. The Respondents reply that Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent provided proof that she had left Brazil in June 2017 and that the objective documentary evidence demonstrates that permanent resident status is lost after an absence of two years from Brazil. The Respondents submit that the RPD was correct in its finding. I find that the RPD was correct in its finding that, on the day of the hearing, the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent had lost her permanent resident status in Brazil. As indicated in her passport, she had left Brazil in June 2017. During her testimony, she stated that she could no longer live in Brazil because it had been over two years since she had left, in June 2017. Although in one of her forms, it was indicated that she had left Brazil in July 2017, when questioned at the hearing she testified that this had been an error, which was found to be a reasonable explanation by the RPD after verifying that there was no stamp after June 2017 from Brazil in her passport. I find the explanation to be satisfactory and consider that the date she left Brazil is established, on the balance of probabilities, to be in June 2017. The objective documentary evidence regarding the loss of a permanent visa issued under Law 6,815 of August 19, 1980, the law under which the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent\u2019s permanent residence card was issued, indicates that those with permanent resident status lose their status following an absence of two years from Brazil. This information was reiterated under the new law that was adopted in Brazil in May 2017, under which a permanent resident who is absent from Brazil for more than two years will lose their status. It is possible to regain this status under certain conditions, which will be examined further in the next section regarding the loss of status. I find that, on the date of the hearing, December 10, 2019, the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent no longer had status in Brazil, as she had been absent from the country for over two years, since June 2017, meaning that her status had expired in June 2019. Loss of previous status Under the Zeng analysis, the next question is, did the Respondent previously have status substantially similar to that of nationals and then lose it? The RPD found that the Respondent previously had status substantially similar to that of nationals, after analyzing the rights and obligations of those with permanent resident status and comparing them to those with Brazilian nationality. As discussed above, the RPD found that the Respondent had then lost this status due to an absence of two years from Brazil. The RPD found that she was not asylum shopping, as she had left Brazil due to her job ending, before returning to Haiti to work, after which she was threatened and attacked. Her reason for claiming asylum, the RPD found, arose after she had left Brazil, and when she had left Haiti in September 2019, she had already lost her status in Brazil. The RPD found that, when considering this along with her credible allegations of persecution in Haiti, she should not be excluded. The Appellant, as discussed above, argues that the permanent resident status was not proven to be lost by the Respondent, but that even if she had lost it, there were avenues to reclaim it of which she did not avail herself. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in not weighing the various Zeng factors once determining that she had lost her status, which they allege led to the incorrect finding that she was not excluded. The Respondents do not contest that the status of the Respondent was substantially similar to that of nationals, but submit that with a Zeng analysis, the correct finding is that the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent is not excluded, as the evidence shows that she was not asylum shopping, in agreement with the reasoning and findings of the RPD. After reviewing the evidence, I am in agreement that the Respondent had status that was substantially similar to that of nationals of Brazil, but find that the documentary evidence demonstrates that the permanent resident status of the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent was lost, therefore the following factors must be considered: reason for loss of status (voluntary or involuntary); whether she could return to Brazil; the risk that she would face in Haiti; Canada\u2019s international obligations; and any other relevant factors. Reason for loss of status (voluntary or involuntary) The RPD found that the Respondent had left Brazil because her job had ended, without categorizing it as voluntary or involuntary. The Appellant argues that the Respondent had left voluntarily, as she chose to leave when her job had ended, despite her permanent resident status there. The Respondents submit that the Respondent had already lost her status in Brazil when her problems arose in Haiti, so she had not been asylum shopping when she left Brazil. Furthermore, the Appellant refers to the case of Noel, in which voluntary loss of permanent resident status contributed to the finding of exclusion. However, that case can be distinguished from the present one in that the claimant in that case had not lost his permanent resident status in Brazil at the time of the RPD hearing, and he had left Brazil after he had left Haiti, allegedly in fear for his life in Haiti. In the present appeal, the Respondent had left Brazil before she alleged having suffered persecution in Haiti, so was not in fear for her life when she chose to leave Brazil. I therefore find that the concerns regarding asylum shopping that may have been present in Noel are different from the present appeal, in which the Respondent left Brazil before she was in fear for her life in Haiti, therefore it cannot be said to have been asylum shopping, as she was not in a situation of having to claim asylum when she left Brazil. Furthermore, unlike the case of Noel in the present appeal, the Respondent\u2019s hearing at the RPD occurred after the two-year time period when she had left Brazil, so she was not in the same position as the claimant in that case. I find that the departure of the Respondent from Brazil was voluntary, in the context that her job had ended in Brazil, and that she had at the time she left Brazil, no reason to fear for her life in Haiti. I consider, when weighing the factors for and against exclusion, that this weighs against exclusion, as it indicates that she was not asylum shopping by leaving a surrogate safe country to seek asylum elsewhere during a situation of persecution. At the time she left Brazil, she was not being persecuted in her home country. Whether Respondent could return to Brazil The RPD found that the Respondent could not return to Brazil, because she had been absent from the country for more than two years, and did not meet one of the requirements to have her status reinstated, according to the national documentary evidence. The Appellant argues that the Respondent failed to prove that she could not meet one of the requirements to reinstate her status. The Respondent submits that the RPD was correct in its findings and that she did not fall into any of the categories of people who would have grounds to reinstate their status in Brazil after an absence of more than two years. I find that the RPD was correct in its finding that the Respondent did not fall into any of the categories that would have allowed her to reinstate her status in Brazil. According to the objective documentary evidence, a new permanent resident visa may be granted to a foreigner who once lived in Brazil as a permanent resident, and then left to pursue university studies, professional training, a professional activity for the Brazilian government or a research activity for the Brazilian government. These conditions are reiterated in multiple sources in the objective documentary evidence. I consider that this finding also weighs against the exclusion of the Respondent. Risk Respondent would face in Haiti The RPD found that the Respondent had established that she faces the serious possibility of persecution should she return to Haiti, based on the Convention ground of imputed political opinion, due to her revealing that one of her co-workers at a Haitian senator\u2019s office had accepted a bribe, following which she was threatened with death and survived two attempts on her life, in March 2018 and July 2019. The Appellant did not contest this finding. The Respondents made no submissions on this finding. After reviewing the testimonial and documentary evidence, including the exhibits produced by the Respondent, particularly: exhibit C4: proof of Respondent\u2019s employment in the Haitian senate; exhibit C5: paystubs from job in Haiti; exhibit C6: statement by Respondent\u2019s father to a Haitian justice of the peace regarding a break-in at her house in March 2018 that is believed to be orchestrated by the agent of harm; exhibit C7: a statement to Haitian authorities regarding the attack of July 2019; exhibits C8 and C9: two witness statements from July 2019 regarding death threats against the Respondent in Haiti; and exhibit C10: Amendment to BOC and new facts regarding recent incidents in Haiti connected to agent of harm, I find that the RPD was correct in finding that she faces a prospective risk in Haiti. I consider that this finding weighs against the exclusion of the Respondent. Canada\u2019s international obligations I consider that Canada\u2019s international obligations, particularly with respect to the Convention, would be met by not excluding the Respondent, as I find that the factors in her situation weigh against excluding the Respondent. Conclusion regarding exclusion The evidence demonstrates, on the balance of probabilities, that the Respondent was not asylum shopping, as she left Brazil before the reason for her asylum claim had come into being, namely the threats to her life that she had suffered in Haiti after her departure from Brazil; I find that her prospective risk in Haiti is established and that she faces the serious possibility of persecution there; I find that she cannot return to Brazil according to the information available in the objective documentary evidence; I find that these factors outweigh the fact that the Respondent left Brazil voluntarily. I find that the RPD was correct in its finding that the Respondent is not excluded and conclude that she should not be excluded under sections 1E of the Convention and 98 of IRPA, when weighing all the relevant factors. ANALYSIS\u2014PERSECUTION IN HAITI Nexus to the Convention As the allegations of the Respondents gives rise to Convention grounds, specifically on the basis of imputed political opinion for the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent, I shall examine the allegations in light of s 96 of IRPA. Credibility As discussed above with respect to the allegations of prospective harm in Haiti, the RPD found that the Respondent was credible. The Appellant did not make any submissions impugning the credibility of these allegations. The Respondents did not make any submissions regarding these findings. After reviewing the testimony in the recording of the RPD hearing, as well as the documentary evidence in the file, I have no reason to doubt the credibility of the allegations regarding the prospective risk in Haiti. I find that she has established, on the balance of probabilities, that in March 2018, she was threatened with death by an individual who worked with her in the senator\u2019s office after she denounced the individual for accepting a bribe, and that she survived two assassination attempts, one in March 2018 and one in July 2019. I further find credible that there have been recent attempts to look for her in Haiti after her departure. I find that the Respondents have provided credible evidence that the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent faces the serious possibility of persecution if she were to return to Haiti, based on her imputed political opinion. She has established that she is subjectively fearful and that her fear is objectively well-founded and forward-facing. State protection The RPD found that the Respondents rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection for the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent in Haiti, with clear and convincing evidence that if she were to approach the authorities for protection there, they would be unwilling or unable to provide it. The Appellant and Respondents did not make submissions regarding this finding. After reviewing the personal and objective documentary evidence, I am in agreement with the RPD\u2019s finding regarding a lack of adequate state protection for the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent in Haiti. In particular, the Respondent had provided written and oral testimony that she had gone to her employer, the senator, a highly placed individual, for help, and he had told her to go into hiding after the threats on her life. This underscores the country conditions regarding the inability of authorities to protect the Respondent, in addition to the information in the objective documentary evidence. IFA After proposing L\u00e9og\u00e2ne as a possible IFA in Haiti and considering the means and motivation of the agent of harm, in conjunction with the objective documentary evidence, the RPD found that there was no viable IFA for the Respondents there. The Appellant and Respondents did not make any submissions regarding this finding. After reviewing the evidence, I am in agreement with the RPD\u2019s finding. I find that, on the balance of probabilities, given the credible evidence by the Respondents regarding the ability and interest of the agents of harm to track down the Respondent Madeleine Marie Toussaint Vincent in Haiti, including the two assassination attempts, the recent attempts of the agent of harm to find her in Haiti, and the occupation of the agent of harm as having the resources and connections available to him of someone who works for the Haitian government, that the agent of harm would have the means and motivation to find the Respondent throughout Haiti and that, as a result, the Respondent would face the serious possibility of persecution throughout Haiti, that there is nowhere in Haiti that would be safe for her to relocate. As the first prong of the IFA test of safety has not been met, there is no need to assess the second prong of reasonableness. CONCLUSION I dismiss the appeal. I confirm the decision of the RPD that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is not excluded under sections 1E of the Convention and 98 of IRPA, and that both XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXXand XXXX XXXXXXXX are Convention refugees.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200116 Docket: IMM-2133-19 Citation: 2020 FC 61 Ottawa, Ontario, January 16, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Ahmed BETWEEN: A.B., C.D., E.F., G.H. Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] This case concerns the decision of the Refugee Appeal Division (\u201cRAD\u201d) (the \u201cRAD Decision\u201d) to uphold the Refugee Protection Division\u2019s (\u201cRPD\u201d) decision finding the Applicants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The Applicants\u2019 refugee claim was based on the threats from the Associate Applicant\u2019s brother in Iraq against the Principal Applicant for her pregnancy allegedly having resulted from adultery. [2] On this application for judicial review, the Applicants submit the RAD Decision unreasonably excluded a piece of evidence that arose after the RPD decision: a transcript of a telephone call between the Associate Applicant and his sister in Iraq about the ongoing danger to the Applicants if they ever returned. The Applicants also submit the RAD erred in upholding the RPD decision despite its misapprehension of the time that passed between the Principal Applicant\u2019s departure from Iraq and the threats against her. The Applicants submit the RAD did not adequately consider the RPD\u2019s misapprehension in its own decision. [3] The RAD Decision is unreasonable for the reasons below. This application for judicial review is allowed. II. Facts [4] A.B. (the \u201cPrincipal Applicant\u201d) and her husband, C.D. (\u201cthe Associate Applicant\u201d) are citizens of Iraq. They have two children E.F. and G.H. (the \u201cMinor Applicants\u201d). E.F. is also a citizen of Iraq, and G.H. is a U.S. citizen. The Applicants are from the northern part of Iraqi Kurdistan. The Principal Applicant and the Associate Applicant have a Canadian-born child, who is not a party to this proceeding. [5] The Principal Applicant and the Associate Applicant married in 2005, and had their son, E.F, in 2007. In 2014, the Associate Applicant left Iraq on a U.S. student visa to pursue his PhD program. In June 2014, a short time after the Associate Applicant had left Iraq, the Principal Applicant found out she was pregnant. When the Associate Applicant\u2019s family learned of the pregnancy, the Associate Applicant\u2019s brother, I.J., accused the Principal Applicant of infidelity and bringing dishonour on the family. I.J., a high-ranking member of a local militia, made approximately eight threatening phone calls to the Principal Applicant over the next ten weeks. The Principal Applicant sought advice at a women\u2019s centre and threatened to call the police. [6] On July 9, 2014, the Principal Applicant and her son, E.F., were granted visas to join the Associate Applicant in the U.S. On August 12, 2014, the Principal Applicant and her son left Iraq. In January 2015, the Principal Applicant and the Associate Applicant\u2019s daughter, G.H., was born. The Applicants remained in the U.S. until 2017, when U.S. authorities informed the Applicants that their visas were no longer valid because the Associate Applicant had lost his research funding and he would have to withdraw from the PhD program. Subsequently, the Applicants travelled to Canada and submitted refugee claims in October 2017. [7] On April 27, 2018, the Applicants\u2019 refugee claim was heard by the RPD. Central to their claim was the fear of persecution from I.J., based on his threats and conduct towards the Principal Applicant. By decision dated May 1, 2018, the RPD found the Applicants were not Convention refugees or persons in need of protection. The RPD found the Applicants would not face a serious possibility of persecution if returned to Iraq. [8] The Applicants appealed to the RAD. Pursuant to subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 (\u201cIRPA\u201d), the Applicants submitted the transcript of a telephone conversation from May 2018\u2014which occurred after the RPD decision\u2014between the Associate Applicant and his sister, who lived in the Applicants\u2019 region of origin and was in regular contact with I.J. By decision dated March 6, 2019, the RAD upheld the RPD\u2019s decision and dismissed the appeal. The RAD refused to accept the new evidence that the Applicants sought to introduce. Contrary to the RPD\u2019s finding that four or five months had passed between I.J.\u2019s learning of the pregnancy and the Principal Applicant\u2019s departure from Iraq, the RAD correctly noted that the time elapsed was only two months and eight days. Nevertheless, the RAD concluded that although I.J. had a \u201cconsiderable period of time\u201d to take concrete action against the Principal Applicant beyond the threatening phone calls, he did not do so. [9] This is the underlying decision for this application for judicial review. III. Issues and Standard of Review [10] The issues on this application for judicial review are: Was the RAD\u2019s rejection of the new evidence reasonable? Did the RAD err in assessing the timeline error of the RPD? [11] Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (CanLII) [Vavilov], the reasonableness standard generally applied to the review of the RAD\u2019s consideration of RPD\u2019s findings, and the RAD\u2019s credibility findings, as in the case at bar: Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93 (CanLII) at paras 30, 34-35; Ilias v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 661 (CanLII) at para 30; Walite v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 49 (CanLII) at para 30; Deng v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 887 (CanLII) at paras 6-7. [12] The applicable standard of review of the RAD Decision must be determined in accordance with the framework set out in Vavilov. As noted by the majority in Vavilov, \u201ca reasonable decision is one that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker,\u201d (Vavilov at para 85). Furthermore, \u201cthe reviewing court must be satisfied that there are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency,\u201d (Vavilov at para 100). In this case, the existing jurisprudence on the applicable standard of review is instructive. The reasonableness standard applies to the case at bar. IV. Relevant Provisions [13] Relevant provisions of section 110 of the IRPA read as follows: Evidence that may be presented \u00c9l\u00e9ments de preuve admissibles 110(4) On appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection. 110(4) Dans le cadre de l\u2019appel, la personne en cause ne peut pr\u00e9senter que des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve survenus depuis le rejet de sa demande ou qui n\u2019\u00e9taient alors pas normalement accessibles ou, s\u2019ils l\u2019\u00e9taient, qu\u2019elle n\u2019aurait pas normalement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s, dans les circonstances, au moment du rejet. [\u2026] [\u2026] Hearing 110(6) The Refugee Appeal Division may hold a hearing if, in its opinion, there is documentary evidence referred to in subsection (3) (a) that raises a serious issue with respect to the credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal; (b) that is central to the decision with respect to the refugee protection claim; and (c) that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the refugee protection claim. Audience 110(6) La section peut tenir une audience si elle estime qu\u2019il existe des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de preuve documentaire vis\u00e9s au paragraphe (3) qui, \u00e0 la fois : a) soul\u00e8vent une question importante en ce qui concerne la cr\u00e9dibilit\u00e9 de la personne en cause; b) sont essentiels pour la prise de la d\u00e9cision relative \u00e0 la demande d\u2019asile; c) \u00e0 supposer qu\u2019ils soient admis, justifieraient que la demande d\u2019asile soit accord\u00e9e ou refus\u00e9e, selon le cas. V. Analysis A. Admissibility of New Evidence [14] The Applicants submit the RAD made a credibility finding by refusing to admit the telephone transcript as new evidence. The Applicants submit the RAD\u2019s reasons for rejecting the new evidence formed credibility findings and demonstrated the RAD\u2019s disbelief of the Applicants\u2019 position that the transcript was genuine. The Applicants rely on Zhuo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 911 (CanLII) [Zhuo] and Horvath v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 147 (CanLII) [Horvath] for the proposition that the RAD is generally required to convene an oral hearing to make a valid credibility finding. [15] The Respondent submits the RAD set out cogent reasons for rejecting the transcript of the purported telephone conversation for its lack of credibility. The RAD had noted several concerns: the Applicants did not provide the original source of phone call; there was no evidence to corroborate that the Associate Applicant was speaking to his sister; without the original recording showing the phone record, the RAD could not confirm that the Associate Applicant had called his sister; and the content of the conversation was vague and of low probative value. The Respondent submits the RAD \u201ccannot admit evidence that is not credible\u201d (See Raza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FCA 385 (CanLII) [Raza]; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Singh, 2016 FCA 96 (CanLII) [Singh]). The Respondent further submits that there is no requirement for the RAD to hold an oral hearing to assess the credibility of the purported telephone conversation. [16] In my view, the RAD reasonably rejected the new evidence. In Singh, the Court considered the scope of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA, and found the three conditions of admissibility set out in the provision are \u201cinescapable and would leave no room for discretion on the part of the RAD,\u201d (Singh at para 35). The Court also found that the implicit criteria identified in Raza\u2014credibility, relevance, newness, and materiality\u2014subject to some adaptations, are also applicable in the context of subsection 110(4) (Singh at paras 38-49). Regarding the assessment of credibility on the admissibility of new evidence, the following excerpt is highly instructive (Singh at para 44): [\u2026] It is difficult to see, in particular, how the RAD could admit documentary evidence that was not credible. Indeed, paragraph 171(a.3) expressly provides that the RAD \u201cmay receive and base a decision on evidence that is adduced in the proceedings and considered credible or trustworthy in the circumstances.\u201d It is true that paragraph 110(6)(a) also introduces the notion of credibility for the purposes of determining whether a hearing should be held. In that regard, however, it is not the credibility of the evidence itself that must be weighed, but whether otherwise credible evidence \u201craises a serious issue\u201d with respect to the general credibility of the person who is the subject of the appeal. [\u2026] [17] In view of the jurisprudence, the Applicants have advanced a misconstrued conception of the application of subsections 110(4) and 110(6) of the IRPA. The RAD is not required to hold an oral hearing to assess the credibility of new evidence\u2014it is when otherwise credible and admitted evidence raises a serious issue with respect to the general credibility of the applicant that the determination of an oral hearing becomes relevant. A \u201ccredibility finding\u201d on the admissibility of new evidence is not equivalent to a credibility assessment on the Applicants. [18] Contrary to the Applicants\u2019 submissions, neither decisions in Zhou or Horvath are helpful for the Applicants\u2019 arguments. The two decisions can be distinguished from the case at bar on the facts and issues. In Zhou, the RAD had admitted new evidence, and then used the admitted evidence to impugn the applicant\u2019s credibility (Zhou at para 2). Similarly in Horvath, the RAD had accepted new evidence that was directly contradictory to the RPD\u2019s findings, which went to the core of the applicants\u2019 credibility (Horvath at para 20). In the case at bar, the RAD rejected the new evidence. [19] The RAD\u2019s rejection of the telephone transcript evidence was reasonable. B. Reasonableness of the RAD Decision [20] The Applicants submit the RAD erred in concluding that the RPD\u2019s erroneous understanding of the Principal Applicant\u2019s timeline in Iraq\u2014in which she received threats from I.J.\u2014did not \u201cmaterially change the analysis\u201d. The Applicants submit that this timeline error was a key aspect in forming the RPD\u2019s frame of mind to assess the overall credibility of the Applicants, which informed the plausibility of the Applicants\u2019 claims, the genuineness of the Principal Applicant\u2019s fear, and an understanding of the Principal Applicant\u2019s pregnancy. [21] I agree with the Applicants\u2019 position. A key concern raised by the RPD member in assessing the Applicants\u2019 credibility was that she was unsatisfied the Associate Applicant\u2019s family or the brother, I.J., had acted on or may act on their disapproval of the marriage between the Principal Applicant and the Associate Applicant. However in this assessment, the RPD largely erred in its understanding of the timing of events, and had inappropriately relied on this erroneous context to find that the profile of the agent of persecution\u2014and thus the Applicants\u2019 allegations\u2014lacked credibility. [22] The RPD noted that when I.J. learned of the Principal Applicant\u2019s pregnancy, he did not act beyond placing \u201cannoying\u201d phone calls, and although his threats via phone calls escalated when the Principal Applicant said she would go to the police, she \u201ccontinued to live in Sulaymaniyah for several months before she joined her husband in the U.S. without seeing any of her in-laws,\u201d (my own emphasis added). The RPD also noted that within the context of \u201chonour\u201d crimes, the perpetrator would be more inclined to harming the target in a \u201cstealthy fashion\u201d when the public is not yet aware of the alleged acts of infidelity, i.e. before a pregnancy begins to show. The Applicants had argued that because the Principal Applicant\u2019s alleged \u201cinfidelity\u201d was not known by others, I.J. would not want to publicly harm the Principal Applicant, but target her privately and in a \u201cstealthy\u201d manner. [23] The RPD then concluded that if I.J. did wish to harm the Principal Applicant in a \u201cstealthy fashion\u201d, he would have had the opportunity \u201cduring the four to five months that the [Principal Applicant] was still in Iraq, and was at her earlier and therefore less visible stage of her pregnancy.\u201d Since I.J. did not harm or attempt to harm the Principal Applicant during these four to five months, the RPD concluded it did not agree with the Applicants\u2019 characterization that I.J. was interested in harming the Principal Applicant. Ultimately, the RPD did not find \u201cthe profile of the associate claimant\u2019s family\u201d to be credible. [24] In reviewing the RPD decision and forming its own assessment, the RAD noted that from the Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence, I.J. would be interested in harming the Principal Applicant before her pregnancy would begin to show, to prevent others from learning of the alleged dishonourable conduct. While the RAD recognized I.J. had only been aware of the Principal Applicant\u2019s pregnancy for about two months (contrary to the RPD\u2019s erroneous finding of four to five months), the RAD concluded this did not materially change the analysis, since I.J. and his family \u201ccontinued to have a limited opportunity to keep the alleged dishonourable conduct from being known\u2026before [the Principal Applicant] left for the U.S.\u201d [25] From the RPD decision, it is evident that the RPD rejected the Applicants\u2019 credibility since the alleged risk of harm never materialized within the four to five months, in which the Principal Applicant\u2019s pregnancy would have begun to show. On an erroneous timeline framework, the RPD had concluded that I.J. was not interested in harming the Principal Applicant in a \u201cstealthy\u201d manner as the Applicants had alleged, since the Principal Applicant was left unharmed even until her pregnancy was visible to the public. This formed a crucial aspect of the RPD\u2019s adverse credibility findings against the Applicants. However, in its own assessment, the RAD continued to draw an illogical conclusion that a timeline of two months or four to five months makes no difference in the analysis. In my view, a correct understanding of the timeline is a significant detail. As noted earlier, conclusions on the plausibility of the Applicants\u2019 narrative and claim, and the truthfulness of the Principal Applicant\u2019s fear would differ depending on the two timelines. Certainly, the credibility of the Applicants\u2019 claim would be lower if I.J. did not take any action to harm the Principal Applicant even until her pregnancy was very visible, since it would imply I.J. had no interest in harming the Principal Applicant before the news became public. However, a finding that I.J. did not yet take action to harm the Principal Applicant over two months, but still had a chance to (while the pregnancy was less visible or not showing), does not preclude the possibility that I.J. would still have a window to act upon his intentions to harm the Principal Applicant. [26] The RAD Decision lacked an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis that is justified in relation to the facts and law (Vavilov at para 85). VI. Certified Question [27] Counsel for each party was asked if there were any questions requiring certification. They each stated that there were no questions for certification and I concur. VII. Conclusion [28] The RAD erred in concluding that the RPD\u2019s erroneous timeline did not materially change the analysis. Thus, the RAD Decision is unreasonable. This application for judicial review is allowed. JUDGMENT in IMM-2133-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The decision is set aside and the matter is to be returned for redetermination by a different decision-maker.

{"doc_text": " RAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAR : MC003450 MC003451 / MC003452 / MC003453 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW These appeals concern four members of the same family, namely, Jaime Ernesto Icaza Hern\u00e1ndez Izquierdo (the principal appellant), his wife, Sof\u00eda Mariana Almaz\u00e1n Orozco (the associate appellant), and their two minor children, Arantxa Carolina Orozco Izquierdo and Alberto Orozco Izquierdo (the minor appellants). They are all citizens of Mexico. A criminal cartel called Los Zetas forced the principal appellant to give them money on several occasions so that he could continue to run his business. He then stopped paying them and closed his business. The Refugee Protection Division (RPD) concluded that the appellants had an internal flight alternative (IFA) in two locations, Durango and Sonora. However, according to the appellants, nowhere in Mexico is safe for them, because Los Zetas have the capacity and motivation to track them anywhere and to take revenge on them for closing their business and no longer paying them. DETERMINATION The appeals are allowed. The determination of the RPD is set aside and the appellants are recognized as persons in need of protection. The RPD\u2019s determination underestimates the possibility that Los Zetas still want to go after the appellants. Closing the business and fleeing put the appellants\u2019 lives in danger and Los Zetas will do anything to locate them. BACKGROUND In his refugee protection claim, the principal appellant states that he had owned a manufacturing facility in Huamantla, in the state of Tlaxcala, which is in central Mexico. In November 2017, two men came to see him and warned him that he would have to begin paying twenty-two thousand pesos every three months to Los Zetas, a well-known criminal cartel in the region. They took his company car as an initial payment. The next payment was due in February 2018, but the principal appellant was late in making it. They then threatened to take one of his children as a hostage. He immediately made the payment of twenty-two thousand pesos to Los Zetas. Los Zetas had also been demanding payments from another business owner in the region, who had decided to close his business and leave the region. Los Zetas found him and killed him along with several of his family members. They left a message beside their bodies: [translation] \u201cNo one escapes from Los Zetas.\u201d In May 2018, the principal appellant was required to make a new payment of twenty-two thousand pesos to Los Zetas. So as to no longer have to pay them, he decided to close his business and leave Mexico. The appellants flew to Canada on April 23, 2018. In its decision, the RPD acknowledged that the principal appellant\u2019s story was credible. However, as Los Zetas only have a regional presence, the RPD was of the opinion that the appellants would be safe if they settled in another region. They specifically identified Durango and Sonora, two cities in the north of the country. The RPD also stated that there is little risk that Los Zetas would want to go after the appellants, given that the principal appellant has closed his business. According to the RPD, that means that the principal appellant no longer has a debt owing to Los Zetas, as the only reason he had been forced to make payments was so that he could continue running his business. The appellants argue that Los Zetas maintain links with other cartels, including those that operate in the regions where the two IFAs are located, which would allow them to locate the appellants if they were there. In addition, they are of the opinion that the RPD erred when it stated that Los Zetas no longer consider the principal appellant to owe them a debt. As new evidence, the appellants wish to present a newspaper article, which mentions that C\u00e1rtel del Noreste, which is active in Durango and Sonora, maintains an alliance with Los Zetas. ADMISSIBILITY OF NEW EVIDENCE In accordance with the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), I can admit only evidence: that arose after the RPD rendered its decision; that was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented to the RPD before the decision was rendered. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must decide whether the evidence is new, credible and relevant before admitting it. I conclude that the newspaper article presented by the appellants meets these requirements. The article did not yet exist at the time of the RPD decision and is certainly relevant to the issue of whether Los Zetas would have the capacity to track the appellants in the two proposed IFA locations. It is unnecessary for me to hold an oral hearing to consider this new evidence since there is no doubt as to its credibility, in my opinion. ANALYSIS I consider that the RPD\u2019s analysis is erroneous in two respects. First, it erred when it stated that Los Zetas would not go after the principal appellant for having closed his business in April 2018 and fleeing the country. Second, the RPD erred when it stated that Los Zetas would not have the capacity to track the appellants if they settled in one of the two proposed IFA locations. The RPD concluded that Los Zetas no longer consider the principal appellant to owe them a debt since he closed his business; however, that conclusion is illogical. It is not true that this was a business tax. The criminal organization forces businesses in the region to pay it sums of money as a way of financing its operations. What Los Zetas expected was that they would receive twenty-two thousand pesos from the principal appellant every three months, not that he would close his business and stop paying them. The appellants presented in evidence photographs that were taken in front of the principal appellant\u2019s business a few months after they had left the country. They show that Los Zetas have been there and have left behind some messages that reveal their displeasure in discovering that the appellants have fled. This clearly shows that, as far as Los Zetas are concerned, the principal appellant has signed his death sentence by acting in this way. The RPD underestimated the possibility that Los Zetas could track the appellants, especially outside of the region, describing the cartel as having become [translation] \u201ca fragmented group.\u201d The documentary evidence implies that Los Zetas may no longer be as powerful as they once were, especially since the arrest of several of their leaders. However, Los Zetas have infiltrated several police services, including their information network, which could be a very efficient way of tracking someone anywhere in Mexico. Furthermore, as shown by the new evidence presented by the appellants, there is a cartel in the region where the two IFAs are located that is associated with [translation] \u201ca branch of Los Zetas,\u201d in particular, the one that operates in the state of Tlaxcala, where the appellants used to live. I am aware that the onus is on the appellants to establish that it is unreasonable for them to seek refuge in a different part of the country before asking for international protection. The assessment is based on a two-pronged test. First, the RPD must be satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of them being persecuted or being subject to a risk of harm in the part of the country where it finds an IFA exists. Second, the conditions in the part of the country being proposed must be such that it would not be unreasonable for the appellants to seek refuge there, in light of all of the circumstances. The RPD concluded that the principal appellant had been personally targeted by Los Zetas. According to the documentary evidence, it is established that Los Zetas members use ground-level informants, monitor social media feeds and accounts, and use mapping software to track authorities. In order to locate people, the members of Los Zetas have developed strategic alliances, including temporary alliances, with criminal groups in other regions. More generally, the cartels use family networks and private investigators to track people, as well as property records and placing GPS trackers on cars. They have the capacity and the necessary resources to track people outside of their area of influence as they have developed alliances with various groups belonging to an extensive network and also use their own tracking methods and corrupt agents. In summary, on a balance of probabilities, I conclude that the appellants would be subjected personally to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment by the members of Los Zetas if they moved elsewhere in Mexico. Furthermore, in my opinion, the appellants have rebutted the presumption of adequate state protection in Mexico. Impunity for human rights abuses remained a problem with extremely low rates of prosecution for all forms of crime. According to the federal government\u2019s statistics agency (INEGI), 94 percent of crimes were either unreported or not investigated. Some police officers, particularly at the state and local level, were involved in kidnapping, extortion, and providing protection for, or acting directly on behalf of, members of organized crime and drug traffickers. Although the national anti-corruption system came into effect in July 2017, pending legislation and delays in making appointments at the federal and state levels have prevented the system from becoming fully operational. According to another source, corruption has been rampant in Mexico for a long time and the country is listed among the most corrupt countries in the world. It ranked as the 95th most corrupt country out of 114 countries evaluated. Endemic violence, coupled with high levels of extortion, are proof of concept that criminal activity in Mexico cannot occur without the complicity of municipal, state or federal authorities and indeed flourishes in this corrupt environment. In light of the evidence before me, I am of the opinion that law enforcement officers and members of organized crime act with complete impunity and in complicity, which rebuts the presumption of adequate state protection in Mexico. CONCLUSION The appeal is allowed. I substitute the determination of the RPD with my own determination that the four appellants are persons in need of protection.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TC006355 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Hamdi Khaled (Appellant) is a citizen of Albania and is appealing a decision of the Refugee Protection Division (RPD), dated February 13, 2020, dismissing his claim for protection. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred in assessing his claim and asks the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) to allow the appeal and determine that he is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection, pursuant to sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) or to refer the matter back to the RPD for redetermination by a differently constituted panel. BACKGROUND The Appellant\u2019s relationship with his first partner began in medical school. Having suspicions, his cousins attacked his partner and forced him to give them details about their relationship. The Appellant\u2019s cousins came to his parents\u2019 home and injured the Appellant who went to the hospital and was treated for the injuries. The hospital called the police. The police, when hearing the Appellant might be involved in a same-sex relationship, harassed him owing to his sexual orientation. In fear, he hid with a friend, then with the assistance of his mother and aunt, he fled to Canada in June 2018. DETERMINATION The determinative issue in this appeal is state protection. I find that the RPD erred in finding that there is adequate state protection in Albania for the Appellant. I find that there is neither adequate state protection nor an internal flight alternative (IFA) for the Appellant in Albania. I allow the appeal. I find that the Appellant is a Convention refugee. THE ROLE OF RAD My role is to look at all of the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence in light of the Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9: Proceedings before the IRB involving Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity and Expression (SOGIE Guideline). NEW EVIDENCE The Appellant requests that two documents be admitted as new evidence. He does not request an oral hearing. The request for new evidence includes: a positive RPD Notice of Decision and Reasons, TB9-05661, dated February 6, 2020; and a positive RAD Notice of Decision and Reasons, TB9-33961, dated March 10, 2020. The Appellant states that the two decisions sought to be admitted as new evidence were not available prior to the rejection of the claim. The Appellant states that one decision is by the same Member of the RPD who decided the case under appeal in this matter and decided on the issue of state protection contrary to the decision under appeal. The second decision sought to be admitted as new evidence is a RAD decision that found an RPD decision by the Member that wrote the decision in this appeal was not correct with respect to the state protection analysis. Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA outlines the provisions with respect to new evidence. It states that an appellant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available at the time of the rejection, or that they could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, the Federal Court of Appeal, in the Singh decision, requires me then to decide if the evidence is new, credible and relevant before I can accept it. The requirements of subsection 110(4) of the IRPA must be satisfied, and I am not granted discretion to admit new evidence unless they are met. I am not convinced that decisions at the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB) are \u201cevidence\u201d as contemplated under subsection 110(4). Generally, court jurisprudence can be employed in making submissions because it forms part of the legal framework, and as such, it is not \u201cevidence.\u201d It goes without saying that the parties before administrative tribunals can cite court cases in support of their position. I would regard jurisprudence from administrative tribunals in a similar light; however, decisions from administrative tribunals are not binding and are highly dependent on the facts and circumstances of the case. Although such decisions can be persuasive and the administrative justice system strives to promote consistency, decision-makers are not bound to follow the outcomes of the decisions of other decisions-makers within that tribunal or board, or other such bodies. In this appeal, the Appellant seeks to introduce an RPD decision that is not available on a public website and a decision of the RAD that is available on a publicly available website. The Appellant has removed any identifiers as to names and other personal information. So long as all personal information is redacted in order to protect the privacy of the claimants and appellants, I do not regard such decisions as confidential. Hence, I find that I do not have to decide if the two documents the Appellant seeks to rely upon are new evidence because I find that they are jurisprudential in nature and can be relied upon in an appellant\u2019s submissions. I will comment further in this decision as to their relevance and in the context of this case as I provide my findings in response to the Appellant\u2019s submissions. In this appeal, the Appellant seeks to employ the RPD\u2019s decision to establish that the Member of the RPD\u2019s decision in that case decided differently with respect to the case on appeal on the same topic, namely, state protection. The Appellant seeks to use the RAD\u2019s decision to establish that the RAD disagreed with the same Member\u2019s analysis on the same topic, that is, state protection. ANALYSIS The RPD found that, having considered the Appellant\u2019s oral and written evidence, the Appellant is credible with respect to his sexual orientation. The RPD found, however, that the Appellant had not rebutted the presumption of state protection with clear and convincing evidence. It found that, should the Appellant return to Albania, he has not established that protection would not be reasonably forthcoming should he seek it or that it is unreasonable for him to seek such protection. The RPD held that international protection is only engaged when national protection is unavailable and in a democratic state and that the claimant has an obligation to make efforts to seek his or her protection unless it would be unreasonable to expect him or her to do so. The RPD noted that a failure to pursue state protection opportunities within the home state will usually be fatal to a refugee claim even where the protective services of the state have gaps or deficiencies. The RPD found that the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package (NDP) establishes that Albania is a functioning democracy. It found that Albania had taken action to deal with corruption and improve police accountability. It also notes that Albania had adopted a non-discrimination law in 2010 which prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity, and in 2015, it noted that Albania legalized same-sex relationships. The RPD also noted that the Albanian government passed some of the most progressive LGBTI protection laws in the Western Balkans and reformed its criminal code to incorporate sexual orientation and gender identity into existing hate crime and hate-speech laws. The RPD notes that there is an institution that investigates complaints of discrimination, and measures are in place to protect victims of discrimination. The RPD also stated that, although Albania passed progressive laws, discrimination and mistreatment persists and particularly in rural areas of the country with reporting of incidents remaining low due to societal attitudes. It notes that homophobia remains high, and a culture of heteronormativity and patriarchy exists. The RPD found that societal attitudes are changing, and the government has made significant efforts to protect LGBTI people. Major events are now held with little incidents attended by high-ranking officials. The RPD notes that the documentary evidence indicates that discrimination does exist again LGBTI people; however, there is a strong presence for support of LGBTI individuals in Tirana. The RPD also notes a number of organizations that have worked to improve acceptance of LGBTI people in Albania. The RPD notes that there has been progress with investigations, prosecutions and convictions in the fight against corruption. The RPD found that, when the Appellant was assaulted by his cousins, the police did not help him. However, the RPD noted that rather than reporting the conduct of the police to the authorities, he left Albania. It found that there was insufficient evidence that these cousins were an ongoing risk to him and that there is insufficient evidence that it would be unreasonable for him to seek protection should it be required. The RPD found that, while the laws were not always implemented effectively, there are efforts being made to address crime and corruption in Albania. The RPD found that, while there is evidence that state protection may not be unfailingly successful, homophobia exists in Albania. The RPD found that, based on the totality of the documentation, the Appellant can seek protection and redress if he is unsatisfied with the treatment from the authorities. Appellant\u2019s Submissions The Appellant submits that the RPD failed to address the facts referenced in his submissions which relied on previous decisions of the RPD and Federal Court decisions pertaining to state protection in Albania, and by failing to do so, the RPD fettered its discretion and breached the rules of natural justice. The Appellant asserts that the jurisprudence states that democracies exist along a spectrum and that the presumption of state protection is eroded whenever there is a lower level of democracy. The Appellant states that the Court requires the decision-make to consider fairness of the electoral process, freedom of the press, civilian control of the military, access to government information and absence of corruption. The Appellant submits that the NDP states that Albania fails in every criterion, is not fully functioning, and is only \u201cpartially free.\u201d The Appellant states that the Courts have stated that the systemic erosion of the rule of law implies that protective legislation may not be followed. The Appellant submits that the RPD did not consider the evidence that the elections in June 2019 were fraudulent. The Appellant states that the evidence is that the June 2019 election left the Albania democracy \u201cin tatters\u201d and in the midst of constitutional crisis. The Appellant states that corruption of government authorities can eliminate the presumption of state protection. The Appellant states that the principles of state protection must be related to the personal situation of the claimant and the evidence in the record. The Appellant states that the RPD is obliged to explain how it determined that Albania had a sufficient democracy and the rule of law requiring the Appellant to complain about the conduct of the police after being rebuffed and threatened by police when in light of the constitutional crises. The Appellant states that it is not enough to say that steps are being taken that will eventually lead to state protection and rather examine what state protection is actually provided at the present time. The Appellant states that the RPD acknowledged that the laws are not being implemented effectively but relies on the government\u2019s efforts to address the issue and that the reform efforts to deal with corruption had no impact. The Appellant states that the RPD erred by not recognizing the evidence on the lack of protection and ineffectiveness of efforts. The Appellant states that the RPD erred in relying on government-enacted laws to protect the LGBTI community and that there were public events where the police acted appropriately. The Appellant states that the reported decline in reports on homophobic violence is only due to a decrease in trust of the police, and the corruption is rising and not falling. The Appellant states that the government itself is preventing reform of anti-corruption institutions. The Appellant states that the RPD required the Appellant to file a complaint that the police failed to investigate the homophobic attack against the Appellant, although the police mocked and threatened him. The Appellant states that the Court had held that the police have abused the LGBTI community in Albania and that complaining only invites attacks by the police. The Appellant also argued that the RPD erred in relying on various institutions, like the Internal Affairs and Complaints and the Office of the Ombudsman and non-governmental organizations. However, investigations into police abuse and corruption do not equate to state protection. The Appellant states that the SOGIE Guideline requires a state protection analysis to focus on the personal circumstances of the Appellant in conjunction with a fact-based analysis of the operational adequacy and effectiveness of the protection. The Appellant submits that the decision-maker needs to examine the degree of actual implementation, the effectiveness of these improvements, considering how state actors and general society continue to treat individuals. The Appellant states that the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant should have to seek further protection with the police after being rebuffed as the Courts have held that such findings place an unreasonable burden on those seeking protection. The Appellant states that the RPD also erred in not reviewing evidence on the record demonstrating that most LBQTI claimants in Canada from Albania were afraid of going to the police, and no one has a favourable experience if they did have an interaction with the police. The Appellant submits that he did report the matter to the police and feared they would harm him if he took additional actions. The Appellant states that the RPD erred in explaining why the Appellant had to repeatedly go to the police and endanger himself when he was abused by them. The Appellant submits that the RPD erred because, while it found state protection in this case, it found there was no state protection in Albania in another matter. The Appellant also found that the RAD had overturned the same RPD Member\u2019s decision who found there was state protection in Albania. The Appellant also submits that the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant\u2019s family does not pose an ongoing threat should he return to Albania since there is evidence that his family will continue to threaten him because of his sexual orientation. Findings on state protection The sole issue in this appeal is whether the Appellant has discharged his onus of establishing whether there is adequate state protection with respect to his claim. I find that the Appellant has rebutted the presumption of state protection and that the RPD erred in finding that there was state protection in the circumstances of this case. The basic legal principle with respect to state protection is that refugee protection is meant to be a form of surrogate protection to be invoked only in those situations where state protection is not available from his or her home state. States are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens, except in situations of where there is a complete breakdown of the government apparatus. The Appellant has the onus to rebut the presumption with clear and convincing evidence that, on a balance of probabilities, state protection is inadequate. In this context, the Appellant\u2019s burden is directly proportional to the level of democracy in the state in question: the more democratic the state\u2019s institutions, the more the claimant must have done to exhaust all courses of action open to them. The adequacy of state protection must be premised on an objective assessment of the state\u2019s ability to protect rather than some subjective fear held by the Appellant. In determining whether protection is adequate, the issue is not only whether a legislative and procedural framework for protection exists but the willingness of the police and other institutions within the government to effectively implement that framework at the operational level. Generally, a contextual approach is required when assessing the availability of state protection and determining whether the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection by taking into consideration the personal situation of the claimant, the particular risk alleged, the agent of persecution, and the country conditions. Further, the SOGIE Guideline requires me to review the introduction of laws, programs or other government action to improve the situation of individuals with diverse SOGIE and assess them \u201cto determine whether state protection is adequate at the operational level\u201d and that the \u201cdegree of actual implementation, the effectiveness, and the durability of these improvements in light of how state actors and the general society continue to treat these individuals needs to be examined.\u201d I have reviewed the information provided in the NDP. It is apparent that Albania has made progress in the past decade to enhance its legislative framework, national policies and institutions to promote and protect the LGBTI community in that country. However, despite the evolving legislative and policy framework, I find that the framework has not been sufficiently implemented to conclude the operational adequacy of protection for the LGBTI community. In reviewing the current situation in Albania, I agree with the Appellant\u2019s submissions that Albania falls on the weaker end on the spectrum of democracies. One document in the NDP notes that democracy in Albania deteriorated in 2019, \u201cthus materializing longstanding fears of rising authoritarianism and a dysfunctional system of mechanisms to check and balance government powers.\u201d The document notes that there was a series of crises affecting Albania\u2019s governing institutions including the resignation of parliamentary opposition, an impeachment procedure against the president and disputes between the courts and parliament. The document gave the country a democracy score of 47.02 out of 100. Although the Albanian government has taken steps to curb corruption, the documentation in the NDP states that corruption remains pervasive. The document notes that the anti-corruption measures have yet to achieve operational capacity, and in-fighting with the legislature has not created a productive environment for progress in this regard. The NDP also notes that efforts have been made to deal with corruption and issues with policing; however, many challenges remain. Another report noted: Police did not always enforce the law equitably. Personal associations, political or criminal connections, deficient infrastructure, lack of equipment, and inadequate supervision often influenced law enforcement. Poor leadership contributed to continued corruption and unprofessional behavior. Authorities continued to address these problems by renovating police facilities, upgrading vehicles, and publicly highlighting anticorruption measures. The Ministry of Interior has established a system of vetting security officials and was vetting the first tranche of 30 high-level police leaders. The NDP notes that there is evidence of a paradigm shift in Albania\u2019s political discourse concerning the LGBTI community with the 2015 adoption of a resolution aiming to protect the rights and freedoms of the LGBTI community in Albania and the adoption of a LGBTI Action Plan 2016-2020. However, the documentation also notes that the persons from the LGBTI community also face obstacles to effective equality in Albania. There is no legislation legitimizing same-sex marriages. The Action Plan \u201cis far from being fully implemented and various obstacles and problems remain.\u201d The document notes that government and other public institutions need to strengthen their work to prevent discrimination and promote equality in education and employment. The NDP also noted: To escape ostracism and various forms of discrimination most LGBTI people continued to conceal their sexual identity. A transgender person who attended the annual LGBTI rally was physically abused by unidentified perpetrators. In May, the NGO PINK Embassy requested that parliament issue an apology to those convicted for their sexual orientation under the Communist regime. The contrast between the efforts to further the legislative and policy framework for the benefit of LGBTI persons and the lack of effective implementation of that framework is best summarized by one report authored by the United Nations Development Programme. The report noted: Although the institutional environment is changing in positive ways, the effects of legal and policy improvements are not yet visible, because they are not being applied in practice. The lack of enactment of legal and institutional measures shows that the government has endorsed its responsibility to protect the rights of LGBTI people more to satisfy the demands of the international community \u2013 and in order to meet the requirements for EU membership in particular \u2013 rather than as a civil duty towards LGBTI citizens. The legislation per se is not a guarantee of the enjoyment of human rights, if it is not backed up with political will and changes in institutional practice. The situation of LGBTI persons in Albania is contradictory. On the one hand, the legislative and institutional environments have improved \u2013 but on the other hand LGBTI people continue to face widespread discrimination and homophobia. Despite the existence of the judiciary system and law enforcement mechanisms, the human rights of LGBTI people are often violated. A recent report noted that there were 421 cases of physical and psychological violence against LGBTI community members. The People\u2019s Advocate of Albania (the Ombudsman), noted in May 2016 on the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT), that violence against the LGBTI community is still a present phenomenon and that the community in many cases faces violence in domestic and public environments. Another report stated that victims reported only 34 cases of crimes against LGBTI people to the authorities due to the fear of coming out, a lack of trust in institutions or previous negative experience with the authorities only taking measures in one case. One report notes that the LGBTI community in Albania has faced harassment by the police when asking for help. Moreover, the NDP outlines that LGBTI individuals continue to experience discrimination from individuals as well as institutions, and the public visibility of LGBTI individuals continues to be very low. Obstacles to addressing discrimination include opposition from state officials, public institutions and the media. Hate speech continues to be an issue. According to one report: Civil society, including NGO Pro LGBT, documented a growing number of hate speech incidents in the media this year, most targeting trans people. Media outlets failed to moderate discussions or take down hateful content. Responding to this trend, Pro LGBT held trainings for journalists, which will continue in 2020. Several positive articles were published afterwards. Hate speech by political leaders and public figures also increased. I agree with the Appellant\u2019s submissions that what is important to understand is not only what efforts are made to enact laws and policies but whether those efforts are implemented. The RPD found that Albania had made progress in developing laws and policies to protect the LGBTI community in Albania; however, it acknowledged that there remains discrimination with respect to this community. It may well be that, at some point in the future, Albania may be able to implement its legislative and policy efforts to provide adequate protection for the LGBTI community; however, at this time, I find that those efforts have not been sufficiently translated to be operationally adequate and sufficiently implemented to protect the Appellant. In this appeal, the evidence is that the Appellant dealt with the police after he was attacked, and rather than assisting him, the police threatened him. I agree with the Appellant\u2019s submissions that the RPD erred in finding that the Appellant should have proceeded to complain to the authorities about how he was treated by the police. There is little or no evidence that the complaint would have had any impact and that he would be protected from further harm from agents of persecution. The Courts have stated that I have to assess whether it is objectively reasonable for the Appellant not to continue to pursue protection from the police or other authorities. I find, in the circumstances of this appeal, that there are sufficient grounds to find that it was objectively reasonable for the Appellant to abandon any further efforts to seek protection from the police. Further, I find that the RPD erred in its implication that the Appellant would no longer face threats of harm from his family. I agree with the Appellant\u2019s submissions that a letter from the Appellant\u2019s mother confirms that the Appellant\u2019s relatives present continuing threats to him because of his sexual orientation. Information in the NDP does confirm that domestic violence remains an issue for the LGBTI community in Albania. I will not address the Appellant\u2019s submissions that the Member of the RPD in this case who found there was state protection found in another case there was no state protection and that the RAD overturned the Member on the issue of state protection in another case. Each case is decided on the particular facts, and as I mentioned, the application of state protection principles must be undertaken contextually. As a result of my findings above, I do not need to address this additional argument. I find that the Appellant has rebutted the presumption of state protection with respect to the particular facts of this case. Internal Flight Alternative I find that the Appellant does not have a viable IFA in Albania. The test for assessing an IFA is well established. It has two prongs: The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger of torture, believed on substantial grounds to exist, in the IFA. Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the claimant to seek refuge there. Under the test, both prongs must be met once an IFA has been identified. I have already noted that information in the NDP states that, while progress has been made within Albania, members of the LGBTI community continue to suffer from discrimination in a number of areas such as employment, in educational institutions and elsewhere in Albanian society. I have also noted that the NDP states that there remains a significant number of hate crimes against members of the LGBTI community in Albania that involved physical, sexual and psychological violence. Owing to the fact that there is a serious risk of persecution in Albania from the Appellant\u2019s family and, most probably, the public, I find the first prong of the IFA has not been met, and I find there is no IFA for the Appellant in Albania. Further, the Appellant provided evidence that his extended family do not accept his sexual orientation, suggesting there are no areas in Albania where the Appellant can reside safely. In summary, I find that the Appellant is a Convention refugee in that there is a serious risk that the Appellant will be persecuted in Albania. I also find, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no state protection or IFA for the Appellant in Albania. CONCLUSION The appeal is allowed. I set aside the RPD\u2019s determination and substitute my own decision and find that the Appellant is a Convention refugee.", "spans": "[{'text': '.', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 4981, 'end': 4982}]", "label": "accepted"}
{"doc_text": " Date: 20200109 Docket: IMM-3369-19 Citation: 2020 FC 21 Ottawa, Ontario, January 9, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Gleeson BETWEEN: RAMONA ADNANI Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] The Applicant, Ramona Adnani, was born in Iran and is a citizen of that country. She is also a citizen of Uruguay, where she moved with her family as a teenager. She arrived in Canada in 2014 on visitor\u2019s visa. In 2016 she claimed protection on the basis that she feared her ex-brother-in-law. [2] The Refugee Protection Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board [RPD] accepted that the Applicant, as a Baha\u2019i woman with liberal views, would face persecution in Iran. However, the RPD refused her claim citing credibility concerns and the availability of state protection and an internal flight alternative in Uruguay. The Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] confirmed the RPD decision on the basis that the Applicant had failed to rebut the presumption that she would receive adequate state protection in Uruguay. She now seeks review of the RAD decision pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001 c 27. [3] For the reasons that follow, I am unable to conclude that the RAD committed any error warranting the Court\u2019s intervention. The application is dismissed. II. Background [4] The Applicant claims that she fears her ex-brother-in-law, who she described as abusive, controlling, and well-connected. In 2002, while her sister and ex-brother-in-law were living in Mexico, he left the Applicant\u2019s sister, kidnapping her daughter. He told the Applicant\u2019s sister that he would harm her and her family if they made efforts to find him [5] In 2016, the Applicant\u2019s niece travelled to Canada from Mexico. Upon arrival, she told the Applicant that her father had threatened to kill her and had previously affirmed his intent to harm other family members, including the Applicant, should the niece attempt to leave him. III. Issues [6] The application raises the following issues: Did the RAD breach the Applicant\u2019s right to procedural fairness by failing to consider current country condition documentation? Did the RAD unreasonably conclude that the Applicant had failed to provide clear and convincing evidence rebutting the presumption of state protection? IV. Standard of Review [7] This application was argued prior to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decisions in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] and Bell Canada v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66. The parties relied on the Dunsmuir framework in advancing submissions on standard of review. I have applied the Vavilov framework here. [8] In Canada Post Corp. v. Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67 [Canada Post] Justice Rowe applied Vavilov in determining the standard of review even though the parties made submissions on the issue on the basis of Dunsmuir. Justice Rowe held that submissions from the parties need not be sought and that no unfairness arises where in applying Vavilov the applicable standard of review and outcome would have been the same under Dunsmuir (Canada Post at para 24). [9] The parties both submit that the second issue is reviewable against the standard of reasonableness (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93 at para 35). I agree. The presumptive standard of reasonableness applies to the review of the second issue under either Dunsmuir or Vavilov. [10] Justice Rowe summarizes the attributes of a reasonable decision in Canada Post: [31] A reasonable decision is \u201cone that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 85). Accordingly, when conducting reasonableness review \u201c[a] reviewing court must begin its inquiry into the reasonableness of a decision by examining the reasons provided with \u2018respectful attention\u2019 and seeking to understand the reasoning process followed by the decision maker to arrive at [the] conclusion\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 84, quoting Dunsmuir, at para. 48). The reasons should be read holistically and contextually in order to understand \u201cthe basis on which a decision was made\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 97, citing Newfoundland Nurses). [32] A reviewing court should consider whether the decision as a whole is reasonable: \u201cwhat is reasonable in a given situation will always depend on the constraints imposed by the legal and factual context of the particular decision under review\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 90). The reviewing court must ask \u201cwhether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 99, citing Dunsmuir, at paras. 47 and 74, and Catalyst Paper Corp. v. North Cowichan (District), 2012 SCC 2, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para. 13). [33] Under reasonableness review, \u201c[t]he burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 100). The challenging party must satisfy the court \u201cthat any shortcomings or flaws relied on . . . are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 100). In this case, that burden lies with the Union. [11] I am also satisfied that my conclusions on the merits of the application would be the same under either framework. I am therefore of the view, having considered the facts, circumstances, and the current sate of the law, that there is no uncertainty as to how the Vavilov decision relates to this application (Vavilov para 144). As in Canada Post, further submissions from the parties are not required to determine the application. I note that neither party has sought to make further submissions. [12] The standard of review to be applied in considering the procedural fairness issue\u2014whether the RAD breached the Applicant\u2019s right to procedural fairness by failing to consider current country condition documentation\u2014is best reflected in the correctness standard. However the true nature of this analysis is a consideration of whether the procedure was fair having regard to all of the circumstances (Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at para 54). V. Analysis A. Did the RAD breach the Applicant\u2019s right to procedural fairness by failing to consider current country condition documentation? (1) New evidence [13] The Applicant argues that in rendering its decision in 2019 the RAD unfairly considered and relied upon a 2016 National Document Package [NDP] instead of the updated NDPs released in 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The Applicant has placed the updated NDP before me as new evidence relevant to the alleged breach of fairness. The Respondent did not object to this evidence. [14] The additional evidence has been filed in support of an alleged breach of procedural fairness. It is admissible as an exception to the general rule that the evidentiary record on judicial review is restricted to the record before the decision maker (Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada v. Canadian Copyright Licensing Agency (Access Copyright), 2012 FCA 22 at paras 19 and 20). The evidence has been considered. (2) There was no breach of fairness [15] The Applicant argues that in failing to address the updated NDPs the RAD acted in a manner that was inconsistent with RAD policy and practice under which members must keep informed of current country conditions by familiarizing themselves with the latest NDPs. The Applicant submits that the updated NDPs contained evidence that was relevant to the issue of state protection. She cites Zheng v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 1359 [Zheng] as authority for the argument that reliance on an out-of-date NDP is a breach of procedural fairness. Specifically, she states that, by relying on an out-of-date NDP, the RAD failed to consider relevant factors, and that had the RAD considered those factors, it may have reached a different conclusion. [16] The Applicant states that the RAD failed to consider the following relevant factors: local police lack the training and staff to enforce restraining orders; more generally, judicial decisions arising out of civil disputes are sometimes ineffectively enforced; \u00b7 62 percent of homicides in Uruguay result from domestic violence; \u00b7 victims of domestic violence without severe physical injuries often do not file complaints; \u00b7 laws aimed at preventing gender violence are not being fully implemented due to logistical barriers; and \u00b7 law enforcement and social services for victims of gender violence in Uruguay are inadequate. [17] Having reviewed the RAD decision, I am not persuaded that relevant circumstances or factors were not considered, including those cited by the Applicant. The RAD recognized that \u201ccountry documentation regarding domestic violence is somewhat mixed\u201d, that \u201cviolence against women is a significant social problem in Uruguay\u201d, and that \u201cthe laws protecting women from violence have notable limitations\u201d. The RAD acknowledged the very factors the Applicant has flagged. In addition, the RAD acknowledged that restraining orders are difficult to enforce in Uruguay and that victims of domestic violence often do not file complaints. [18] In Zheng the breach of fairness arose and relief was granted because the Board failed to disclose an updated version of the NDP that was less favourable to the decision maker\u2019s position. On these facts Justice Richard Mosely concluded that changes to the documents were not so trivial as to allow him to conclude the decision maker would have reached the same result notwithstanding the nondisclosure. [19] Although the RAD cites the 2016 NDP in this instance, it is evident that the RAD was aware of, acknowledged and addressed the factors and circumstances the Applicant has pointed to in advancing the fairness argument. The factors and circumstances relevant to the RAD\u2019s state protection analysis have been worded differently in the updated country condition documents. However, I am not convinced the wording changes reflect any change in substance. The differences between the 2016 NDP and the updates in this case are trivial and accordingly I am not prepared to set aside the RAD decision on the basis of a breach of procedural fairness. B. Did the RAD unreasonably conclude that the Applicant had failed to provide clear and convincing evidence rebutting the presumption of state protection? (1) The RAD\u2019s treatment of similarly situated individuals\u2019 evidence was reasonable [20] In its analysis, the RAD first noted that absent a complete breakdown, states are presumed to be capable of protecting their citizens and that a claimant must bring clear and convincing evidence to rebut this presumption. [21] The RAD then considered two incidents recounted by the Applicant where victims of domestic violence had sought state protection. Both involved women who called the police alleging violence by their romantic partners. In both cases, the police responded to the calls. In one of the incidents, the couple was reportedly told to \u201ckiss and make up\u201d and the female victim was advised that she could file a police report but the police would not do so automatically. [22] In considering the examples provided the RAD noted that the circumstances of the Applicant differed. In the recounted instances the violence was perpetrated by a romantic partner. By contrast, the Applicant in the present case feared violence from her ex-brother-in-law. The RAD then noted that the Chairperson\u2019s guidelines broadly define domestic violence as including violence perpetrated against women by family members and accepted that the Applicant\u2019s sister had been a victim of domestic violence that impacted upon the entire family, including the Applicant. However, the RAD also noted that the Applicant\u2019s ex-brother-in-law has been living outside Uruguay for the past 19 years and has never directly threatened or harmed the Applicant. [23] The Applicant argues that the RAD erred in distinguishing her circumstances from those of the victims in the examples she provided. She submits that the definition includes conjugal and other family violence and that the examples demonstrated that the Uruguayan police were not able to protect women from domestic violence. I disagree. The RAD did not discount the broad definition of domestic violence. Instead it recognized that domestic violence extends to family members and then considered the Applicant\u2019s specific circumstances: she was not threatened by a romantic partner; she did not live with her ex-brother-in-law; she had never been directly threatened or harmed by him; and he had been living outside Uruguay for almost 20 years. The RAD\u2019s reasoning process is transparent and easily understood. (2) Failure to test state protection [24] The Applicant also argues that the RAD unreasonably relied upon her failure to test state protection in Uruguay as she was in Canada at the time her fear arose. [25] The RAD does state that the Applicant had testified that she had never sought the protection of the authorities in Uruguay. The statement is made immediately after the RAD notes that simply doubting state protection is insufficient to rebut the presumption. The RAD makes no further reference to the Applicant not having sought protection in its analysis. Considering the decision holistically and reading the RAD\u2019s reference to the Applicant having never sought protection in context, I am not persuaded that the RAD relied on the Applicant\u2019s failure to seek protection as a determinative factor in concluding she had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection. (3) The RAD did not ignore material evidence [26] The Applicant further argues that the RAD ignored material evidence rebutting the state protection presumption. [27] The evidence the Applicant asserts was ignored is the information contained in the updated NDPs and identified above at paragraph 16 above. The Applicant acknowledges that the RAD benefits from a presumption that it considered all the evidence before it. However, she argues that the evidence in issue directly contradicts the RAD\u2019s conclusions, and that the failure to address it renders the decision unreasonable. [28] While a reviewing court may intervene where a decision maker fails to refer to evidence that directly contradicts its conclusion, in this case the RAD did not ignore the information. As I have already concluded, the evidence was reflected in the 2016 NDP in words that may have differed in form but not substance. In addition, most of the factors the Applicant relies upon in advancing this argument were expressly or implicitly reflected in the RAD decision. (4) The RAD\u2019s analysis was more than a regurgitation of country condition documentation followed by a conclusion [29] Finally, the Applicant argues the RAD failed to engage in an analysis of the evidence but instead \u201cmerely regurgitated\u201d the country condition evidence it references in its decision. [30] In advancing this argument the Applicant relies on the reasons of Justice Donald Rennie in Navarrete Andrade v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 436 [Navarrete Andrade]. There, Justice Rennie states that \u201c[i]t is insufficient to merely summarise large volumes of evidence and then state a conclusion that state protection is adequate\u201d. Instead the evidence must be connected to the conclusion by a line of reasoning (Navarrete Andrade at para 28). [31] In support of its conclusion that the Applicant had failed to establish that state protection in Uruguay is inadequate, the RAD first engaged in a review of the country condition evidence. Unlike the situation in Ruszo v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 397, the RAD did not simply regurgitate documentary evidence. Instead, it summarized in bulleted form what the documentary evidence disclosed on matters relevant to state protection including the protections provided to women confronted with domestic violence. The RAD\u2019s summary addressed both efforts and the effectiveness of state efforts to provide protection. The RAD also addressed the Applicant\u2019s documentary evidence. The RAD acknowledged the evidence was mixed. [32] Having engaged in this review, it was open to the RAD to conclude, as it did, that the objective evidence did not indicate a failure of state protection. It was similarly open to the RAD, in the context of a decision where the Applicant\u2019s personal circumstances had previously been reviewed and considered, to conclude that the Applicant had failed to demonstrate with clear and convincing evidence that it was objectively unreasonable for her to seek state protection or that that state protection would not be forthcoming should she seek it. [33] Reading the RAD\u2019s reasons holistically and contextually I understand the basis upon which it reached its conclusions. VI. Conclusion [34] The application is dismissed. The parties have not identified a serious question of general importance for certification and none arises.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : VC001332 VC001333 VC001334 VC001335 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW I allow the appeals and refer them to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) for redetermination. Jorge Ju\u00e1rez M\u00e9ndez (the Principal Appellant or the PA), Mateo Romero M\u00e9ndez (the Associate Appellant or the AA), Melanie Pi\u00f1a Andrea Jim\u00e8nez M\u00e9ndez (the Minor Female Appellant #1 or the MFA #1), and Nicole Flores Isabella M\u00e9ndez (the Minor Female Appellant #2 or the MFA #2) are citizens of Mexico. The Appellants fear persecution and/or section 97(1) harm at the hands of armed men, who robbed and attempted to kidnap the Principal Appellant on April 15, 2019 in Cancun, Mexico. After this incident, the PA received two threatening text messages. The PA went to the police, but the police allegedly refused to get involved. The Appellants rushed to flee Mexico. They felt that they would be easily identified by the alleged agents of harm; the Appellants are Black, and the adult Appellants originate from the Republic of the Congo (RC). The Appellants arrived in Canada on May 12 2019. It is important to note that in 2010, the AA obtained refugee protection in Mexico due to the sexual assault and torture that she suffered in her homeland. The RPD rejected the Appellants\u2019 claims, as the alleged risk was generalized. There was insufficient evidence that the PA was targeted and/or threatened by the Los Zetas cartel. The Appellants contend that the RPD erred by failing to adequately consider the documentary evidence, overemphasizing omissions in the Basis of Claim (BOC) forms and mischaracterizing the nature of the Appellants\u2019 risk. The Appellants were unrepresented at the RPD hearing. On appeal, they are requesting to admit new evidence and to hold an oral hearing. The determinative issue is generalized risk. I find that the RPD erred. The RPD mischaracterized the Appellants\u2019 risk of harm by overemphasizing the importance of the Los Zetas cartel to the merit of the Appellants\u2019 overall claims. Moreover, close examination of the threats reveals, on a balance of probabilities, that they were sent by the Appellants\u2019 assailants and/or their associates. I am unable to confirm or set aside the RPD\u2019s decision without hearing evidence that was presented to the RPD. Accordingly, the matter must be sent back to the RPD for redetermination. DECISION The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the RPD to be redetermined. NEW EVIDENCE The evidence presented by the Appellants is rejected According to the law, I can only accept evidence that: arose after the RPD\u2019s decision; or was not reasonably available at the time of the decision; or that the Appellants could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to bring to the RPD before the decision. If none of these criteria are satisfied, the inquiry ends there; the evidence cannot be admitted. If the evidence meets one or more of these requirements, I must then decide if the evidence is credible, relevant, and new. The evidence will not be considered if it lacks credibility as to its source and the circumstances in which it came into existence or if it is incapable of proving or disproving a relevant fact to the refugee claim. The evidence will also be excluded if it fails to prove a new fact, event, or circumstance arising after, or unknown at the time of, the RPD hearing. The Appellant bears the responsibility of making full and detailed submissions about how the proposed new evidence meets the requirements of subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and how that evidence relates to the claim. The substantive content of the new evidence consists of two statements from persons whom the Appellants knew in Mexico. The documents are dated May 17 and May 20 2020, though they exclusively describe events that occurred in April 10 and 12 2019, well prior to the date of the RPD\u2019s decision (February 10, 2020). The Appellants submit that they had a difficult time preparing for the RPD hearing; the couple have two young children (the MFAs), and the AA was pregnant at the time. Added to the fact that they were unrepresented, the Appellants essentially argue that they could not reasonably have been expected, under the circumstances, to obtain these corroborative statements and provide them to the RPD. Counsel suggests that, in the interest of fairness, a strict interpretation of the admissibility test should not be applied in this case. I disagree. I am tasked with applying the law, and I do not have the discretion to apply it less strictly. To be clear, the Appellants\u2019 particular circumstances are certainly relevant in deciding whether they acted diligently in presenting their entire case to the RPD. An appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is not an opportunity to correct a deficient record. The Appellants submitted their BOC forms on June 15, 2019, approximately one month after arriving in Canada. They completed these forms without the assistance of an interpreter or legal counsel. The RPD hearing took place over six months later, on January 29, 2020. Though unrepresented, the sophistication of the adult appellants is shown by the fact that they can both communicate in French and Spanish and have extensive education and employment histories. The PA has a background in cinema studies and television, while the AA\u2019s training is in production. I further note that in June 2019, the AA was communicating via WhatsApp with Mr. Roberto Cortez, the author of the letter of June 20, 2020. Likewise, the statement of Ms. Alicia Mart\u00ednez was sent to the PA, by e-mail, on June 18, 2020. Under these circumstances, I find that the Appellants had ample time to adduce relevant evidence prior to the RPD\u2019s decision. Evidence which corroborates the Appellants\u2019 central allegations would obviously be highly probative. Soon after arriving in Canada, the Appellants communicated electronically with an acquaintance from Mexico, thereby facilitating the exchange of information and/or documents, as needed. On a balance of probabilities, the adult Appellants\u2019 personal family obligations and lack of legal training are not sufficient to warrant admissibility of the new evidence under any of the statutory criteria set out at subsection 110(4) of the IRPA. The Appellants have failed to establish that the supporting letters were not reasonably available before the RPD\u2019s decision, or that they could not have reasonably been expected to present such letters to the RPD before that date. An oral hearing is not permitted Since I have not admitted any new evidence, I am not permitted to hold an oral hearing, pursuant to subsection 110(6) of the IRPA. ANALYSIS The role of the RAD The RAD reviews the RPD\u2019s decision and comes to an independent assessment of the refugee claim. In providing a final determination, the RAD will intervene if it finds that the RPD erred, unless the RPD\u2019s decision can be confirmed on another basis. The standard of correctness applies. If the RPD has a meaningful advantage in assessing the credibility of oral testimony, then the RPD\u2019s finding may be accorded deference. In this case, the RPD did not have a meaningful advantage. Accordingly, I have conducted an independent assessment of the oral and documentary evidence using the correctness standard. The RPD partially erred in assessing the applicable countries of reference I note that at the RPD hearing, the Appellants were generally unaware of the citizenship laws of the RC. As a result, the RPD relied on the objective evidence found in the National Documentation Package (NDP). I find that the RPD partially erred in interpreting that evidence. The Appellants are Mexican citizens, as evidenced by their Mexican passports. Though the adult Appellants were born in the RC, I agree with the RPD\u2019s reasoning that the PA and AA automatically lost their Congolese nationality upon voluntarily acquiring Mexican citizenship in 2017 and 2014, respectively. Re-integration as a Congolese national is possible but only at the discretion of the government. For those reasons, Mexico is the sole country of reference for the PA and the AA. The status of the Mexican-born Minor Appellants is more nuanced. When the MFA #1 was born in 2011, her parents were not yet Mexican nationals. The Congolese citizenship of the adult Appellants was conferred automatically to the MFA #1 by operation of law. She did not voluntarily acquire another citizenship; she is a Mexican national by birth. Therefore, the forfeiture provisions do not apply. Absent an express application to the RC government, the MFA #1 continues to be a Congolese citizen. Therefore, I find that the MFA #1 is a national of both Mexico and the Republic of Congo. The MFA #2 was born in 2015. At that time, only her father was a Congolese national. At birth, she was a Congolese national, pursuant to the filiation provisions of the nationality law. However, the provisions stipulate that if the minor is a citizen of another country and, while still a minor, both parents become foreign nationals, then the minor is deemed to have never been a Congolese national. This provision applies uniquely to the MFA #2. Because both the PA and the AA are now exclusively Mexican nationals and the MFA #2 is still a minor, then I find that she is not a Congolese national and, instead, solely a national of Mexico. In light of my determinative findings, below, I will direct the RPD to assess whether the MFA #1 faces a serious possibility of persecution, or, on a balance of probabilities, section 97(1) harm in the Republic of Congo. The RPD erred in assessing the Appellants\u2019 risk of harm The RPD accepted that the PA was attacked by armed men, who, at gunpoint, stole $2000 USD and attempted to kidnap him. Furthermore, the RPD accepted that, following this robbery, the PA was threatened on two occasions via text messages. I agree with these findings. Nevertheless, after reviewing the evidence, I find that the RPD erred by failing to fulsomely describe the nature of the Appellants\u2019 risk. The RPD\u2019s determination was premised on two main findings. There was a significant discrepancy between the PA\u2019s BOC narrative and his testimony, in that the former did not identify the Los Zetas cartel as the Principal Appellant\u2019s attacker and did not mention that the PA had previously resisted the recruitment efforts of this drug trafficking syndicate. Secondly, the RPD found that the PA failed to establish a connection between the attack of April 10, 2019 and the threatening text messages. I find that, while a negative credibility finding is warranted in the circumstances, the inconsistency is not fatal to the Appellants\u2019 refugee claims. I agree with the RPD that the Appellants presented insufficient evidence to establish that the agents of harm are affiliated with the Los Zetas cartel. However, the analysis must go a step further. I must consider whether, even if the Los Zetas cartel is not the agent of harm, the evidence before me establishes, on a balance of probabilities, that the Appellants face a personal and non-generalized risk of harm, pursuant to subsection 97(1) of the IRPA. After considering the full nature of the risk, I am led to an affirmative conclusion. Furthermore, the RPD conflated the two-part assessment; the harm encompassed by paragraph 97(1)(b) must be both personal and non-generalized. At approximately 6:30 p.m. on April 12 2019, the PA was at the Playa Blanco resort in Cancun, where he worked as a assistant bartender. Two men surrounded the PA and demanded that he follow them. The PA was searched, and his belongings were taken, all at gunpoint. The Principal Appellant was forced to walk along the beach, and at some point, he was ordered to kneel. The gun was pointed at his head. A black vehicle arrived, and when the PA was about to be forced into the vehicle, he wrestled himself free and ran. Gunshots were fired, but he never looked back. He managed to escape, relatively unscathed. A couple of days later, on April 14 2019 the PA received a text message from an unknown number indicating: \u2026your people already think they\u2019re untouchable, you fucking sluts a lot of fear because you didn\u2019t go to work today\u2026 \u2026we\u2019re all over the territory we\u2019re going to fuck you up for everything when we will be torturing you you\u2019re going to scream son of a bitch we\u2019re going to kill you the thing is that easy (sic). A second expletive-laced message from the same phone number was received on April 8th, threatening to kill the PA and sexually assault his wife and daughters. I note that the RPD Record only includes translations of the messages and not copies of the originals. Nevertheless, on a balance of probabilities, I find that the threats both substantively and temporally coincide with the April 12, 2019 attack on the PA. The first message references the PA\u2019s workplace, where he was apprehended days earlier. The allusion to his absence from work implies that the PA was being monitored. The messages were both received within two days of the attack. I note that the Appellants fled Mexico the day after the second text message. The evidence cumulatively establishes a personal risk to each Appellant in Cancun, namely, a risk to life and to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The ongoing nature of the risk is evidenced by the fact that the PA escaped his captors, was shot at and, soon thereafter, began receiving threatening messages. Moreover, the risk is non-generalized. It is not akin to natural catastrophes such as famine, drought, or earthquakes. The risk goes beyond generic threats of extortion or kidnapping. In this case, the risk of harm carries gendered and racial components, in light of the threats of sexual assault against the AA and the MFAs, and the Appellants\u2019 experience in Cancun as racialized minorities. Therefore, despite being unable to establish the precise identities of the agents of harm, the Appellants presented sufficient evidence of a forward-facing personal and non-generalized risk to life and to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Cancun. The matter must be sent back to the RPD for redetermination I am mindful that the Appellants were unrepresented at the RPD hearing. Though the issue of internal flight alternatives (IFAs) was canvassed at the hearing, the breadth of the questioning was inadequate to determine whether the proposed IFAs were safe and reasonable. I find that there is insufficient evidence in the record to determine that question. The Appellants\u2019 risk of harm outside of Cancun must be re-examined, in addition to the availability of state protection. Moreover, I concluded earlier that the MFA #1 still retains Congolese nationality. The RPD is directed to re-evaluate her refugee claim in light of this finding. CONCLUSION The appeal is allowed. I send this matter back to the RPD to be redetermined. DIRECTIONS TO THE RPD The Appellants\u2019 refugee claims are referred back to the RPD with the following directions: The matter is to be heard by a different RPD panel. The RPD is to decide whether the Minor Female Appellant #1 faces a serious possibility of persecution or, on a balance of probabilities, a risk of section 97(1) harm in the Republic of the Congo. The RPD is to decide whether adequate state protection would be reasonably forthcoming for the Appellants in Mexico. The RPD is to decide whether the Appellants\u2019 risk of harm \u2013 as described in paragraphs 28 to 34, above \u2013 extends throughout Mexico. The RPD is to determine whether a viable internal flight alternative exists. The RPD is to evaluate the Appellants\u2019 credibility, and, in particular, the credibility and trustworthiness of the documentary evidence.

[2] First of all, I am of the view that the IAD was correct in finding that Ms. Tonda\u2019s orphaned niece, who is the subject of her sponsorship application, does not fall within the exception in this provision. [3] However, Ms. Tonda filed before the Court, as new evidence, a judgment granting simple adoption of the child Oganda Victoria (the subject of the sponsorship application by Ms. Tonda and her husband), rendered by the court of first instance of Libreville, Gabonese Republic, and dated January 22, 2019. [4] While the reviewing court will, in principle, refuse to consider any evidence that was not before the administrative decision maker, it may do so when deciding a question of procedural fairness, or when the grounds for review are based on some jurisdictional error (Canadian Union of Public Employees, Local 301 v Montr\u00e9al (City), [1997] 1 SCR 793, at para 86; McFadden v Canada (Attorney General), 2005 FCA 360, at para 15). [5] Since the only issue currently before the Court is whether the IAD had jurisdiction to hear Ms. Tonda\u2019s appeal, and since the new evidence is relevant to the analysis of that issue, it is allowed. [6] That said, as a specialized administrative tribunal, the IAD is in the best position to determine whether the simple adoption judgment rendered on January 22, 2019, by the Gabonese Court is such as to make Victoria Ms. Tonda\u2019s dependent child within the meaning of the IRPA. The matter is therefore returned to the IAD for redetermination on the issue of its jurisdiction and, if appropriate, on the merits of the appeal. [7] The parties did not propose any questions of general importance for certification, and no such question arises from the facts of this case. JUDGMENT in IMM-2108-19 THIS COURT ORDERS as follows: The application for judicial review is allowed; The decision of the Immigration Appeal Division, dated March 12, 2019, is set aside, and the matter is returned to the Immigration Appeal Division for redetermination. \u201cJocelyne Gagn\u00e9\u201d Associate Chief Justice Certified true translation This 31st day of January 2020.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200123 Docket: IMM-3367-19 Citation: 2020 FC 100 Ottawa, Ontario, January 23, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Ahmed BETWEEN: OSAS SHARON OKOHUE JADA EFOSA (a minor) BELVIS EFOSA (a minor) Applicants and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] This case concerns the decision of a senior immigration officer (the \u201cOfficer\u201d) of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\u201cIRCC\u201d) to deny the Applicants\u2019 application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate (\u201cH&C\u201d) grounds. The Officer rejected the application on the basis that it did not provide sufficient evidence to justify an exemption under section 25(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 (\u201cIRPA\u201d). [2] The Applicants are citizens of Nigeria, whose refugee claims were refused by the Refugee Protection Division (\u201cRPD\u201d) on November 3, 2015. The appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (\u201cRAD\u201d) was dismissed on April 11, 2016. The Applicants also received a negative Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (\u201cPRRA\u201d) decision on December 22, 2017. [3] The Applicants submit that the Officer breached procedural fairness by considering extrinsic information not disclosed to the Applicants. The Applicants also submit that the Officer unreasonably assessed the evidence. [4] For the reasons that follow, I find the Officer\u2019s decision is reasonable. This application for judicial review is dismissed. II. Facts [5] Mrs. Osas Sharon Okohue (the \u201cPrincipal Applicant\u201d) and her 8-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son, Jada and Belvis, (the \u201cMinor Applicants\u201d) (collectively, the \u201cApplicants\u201d) are citizens of Nigeria. The Principal Applicant also has a 4-year-old daughter, Elvira, who is also a Canadian citizen. [6] The Applicants entered Canada on February 10, 2015 and submitted refugee claims. On November 3, 2015, the RPD refused the claims. The RPD\u2019s decision was appealed, but on April 11, 2016, the RAD dismissed the appeal. The Applicants received a negative PRRA decision on December 22, 2017. [7] The Applicants submitted an H&C application, which was received by IRCC on January 5, 2018. By decision dated April 25, 2019, the H&C application was refused. [8] The Applicants\u2019 H&C application consists of a brief 7-page submission accompanied by supporting documentation and country condition evidence. In the H&C application, the Applicants submitted that they would face hardship to re-establish themselves in Nigeria, based on the \u201cbizarre\u201d country conditions in Nigeria. The Applicants submitted that they would have no place to return to in Nigeria because the Principal Applicant\u2019s family members have fled from their homes due to attacks by the Principal Applicant\u2019s husband. The Applicants noted they would face hardship due to high levels of unemployment, a high level of insecurity through the \u201csocio-political and religious crisis\u201d, inability to afford quality medical care, and a lower quality of life in Nigeria. [9] The Applicants also submitted that the Principal Applicant is \u201cfinancially stable, filed tax and has contributed to the Canadian economy\u201d. [10] On the best interests of the children (\u201cBIOC\u201d), the Applicants submitted that the children could not return to Nigeria due to the inadequate health-care and education systems. The Applicants submitted that Nigeria \u201cis plagued by multiple life-threatening problems, ranging from risk to life due to recurring bomb blasts, incessant incidence of kidnappings, police brutality, religious intolerance, inadequate health-care, etc., which in combination will result in undue, unusual, undeserved and disproportionate hardship to the applicants.\u201d The Applicants submitted that the Principal Applicant lost her first daughter to \u201ccircumcision\u201d\u2014referring to female genital mutilation (\u201cFGM\u201d)\u2014and argued the Applicants would likely \u201cfall back into the hands of their assailants if they are forced to return to Nigeria\u201d. [11] The Applicants also submitted that there is a lack of state protection in Nigeria. They alleged that there are \u201creal and potential barriers to seeking protection in a country where police corruption and brutality remains a serious threat to the protection of individual human rights.\u201d III. Underlying H&C Decision [12] After noting the Applicants\u2019 immigration history, the Officer considered the Applicants\u2019 establishment in Canada. The Officer noted that the Principal Applicant is currently employed and considered the counsel\u2019s submission that the Principal Applicant will be unable to enter the workforce due to high unemployment rates. Although recognizing that a less favourable economic climate existed in Nigeria, the Officer noted the process of reestablishment in such circumstances is an ordinary consequence of removal, and found that the Principal Applicant would be able to find gainful employment in Nigeria as she worked as a hairdresser for eight years in Nigeria prior to her departure to Canada. The Officer also noted the Principal Applicant\u2019s overseas work experience could provide her with a competitive advantage in finding employment in Nigeria. [13] The Officer assigned some positive weight to the Principal Applicant\u2019s attendance at her church. However, the Officer did not find the Principal Applicant\u2019s overall establishment in Canada to be significant. The Officer found that the Principal Applicant demonstrated adaptability skills by uprooting her family to Canada, which would mitigate difficulties in relocating back to Nigeria, where she resided for over 30 years and where she would be familiar with the local culture, language and customs. The Officer further noted the Applicants\u2019 strong family ties in Nigeria, and found there was insufficient evidence that the Principal Applicant\u2019s family would be unwilling or unable to assist the Applicants with support. [14] On the issue of the BIOC, the Officer found there to be insufficient evidence that the children would be denied an adequate education in Nigeria. Relying on the 2018 U.S. Department of State (\u201cUSDOS\u201d) Human Rights Practices Report, the Officer noted the law requires a tuition-free, compulsory, and universal basic education for primary and junior education. The Officer noted that discrimination and impediments to female participation in education existed in the Northern region of Nigeria, but found there to be insufficient evidence that the Applicants would be denied education in their hometown of Benin City, which is in southern Nigeria. [15] The Officer noted there would be an initial adjustment period in relocating to Nigeria given the young age of the children. However, the Officer concluded there was insufficient evidence that the children\u2019s basic needs will not be met in Nigeria, as they have extended family ties and they will have the support of their mother. Overall, the Officer did not find that the BIOC would be negatively impacted if the family were to leave Canada. [16] Although section 25 of the IRPA prohibits an assessment of risk (pursuant to sections 96 and 97), the Officer recognized that elements of adverse country conditions must be examined in relation to hardship, on a forward-looking basis. In response to counsel\u2019s submissions that the Applicants would be unable to find quality medical care, the Officer noted that there is insufficient evidence regarding any specific medical conditions. Also, although there are several general country condition documentation pertaining to kidnappings, police brutality and impunity, the Officer found there to be insufficient evidence \u201csupporting a personalized impact from political or any religious crisis.\u201d The Officer noted general country conditions are faced by all citizens of Nigeria, and concluded there could be no finding of associated hardship without evidence that the conditions would personally and directly impact the Applicants. [17] On the issue of FGM, the Applicants had submitted they were at risk because the children\u2019s father\u2019s family wishes to perform FGM on the daughters. The Principal Applicant had claimed one of her daughters died as a result of FGM. However, the Officer noted that despite the presence of a death certificate, there was insufficient information in relation to the details or cause of the daughter\u2019s death. In addition, the Officer considered the letter written by the Principal Applicant\u2019s sister, in which she stated the Principal Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s family destroyed her family home and attacked everyone, and that a police complaint been made in May 2017. However, the Officer noted insufficient evidence to support this allegation other than undated, black and white photos of a destroyed structure. [18] Citing excerpts from the 2018 USDOS Human Rights Practices Report, and the United Kingdom Home Office Report, the Officer accepted that FGM continues to be an ongoing practice in Nigeria, but noted the Applicants could relocate to Abuja, the capital city of Nigeria, where a federal legislation against FGM was being enforced. The Officer noted there was insufficient evidence that the family of the Principal Applicant\u2019s husband would locate the Applicants in a populated urban area of Nigeria. The Officer found that the Principal Applicant\u2019s adaptability skills could be applied to an internal move within Nigeria. The Officer notes, \u201cAs relocation is an option, and the applicant has not provided information to support the hardship behind relocating to another part of the country, I am not satisfied the applicant could not re-establish herself in another area of Nigeria.\u201d [19] In conclusion, the Officer found the factors raised by the Applicants were not sufficient to warrant an exemption based on H&C grounds. IV. Issues and Standard of Review [20] The issues on this application for judicial review are: Did the Officer breach the duty of procedural fairness by considering extrinsic information not disclosed to the Applicants? Was the Officer\u2019s decision reasonable? [21] The applicable standard of review must be determined in accordance with the framework set out in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (CanLII) [Vavilov]. The revised standard of review analysis begins with the presumption of reasonableness, which can be rebutted in two types of situations. The first is where the legislature has indicated that it intends a different standard to apply, i.e. where it has explicitly prescribed the applicable standard of review, or where it has provided a statutory appeal mechanism from the administrative decision maker to a court (Vavilov at para 17). [22] The second situation is where the rule of law requires that the standard of correctness be applied, for example in certain categories of legal questions, namely constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, and questions related to the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (Vavilov at para 17). [23] First, the correctness standard continues to apply to issues of procedural fairness. In Vavilov at paragraph 23, the Supreme Court states: Where a court reviews the merits of an administrative decision (i.e., judicial review of an administrative decisions other than a review related to a breach of natural justice and/or the duty of procedural fairness), the standard of review it applies must reflect the legislature\u2019s intent with respect to the role of the reviewing court, except where giving effect to that intent is precluded by the rule of law. The starting point for the analysis is a presumption that the legislature intended the standard of review to be reasonableness. [24] A reading of paragraphs 76 to 77 in Vavilov reveals the Supreme Court\u2019s acknowledgement that the \u201crequirements of the duty of procedural fairness in a given case\u2026will impact how a court conducts reasonableness review.\u201d This is instructive for a reviewing court to first determine whether a duty of procedural fairness exists, and in light of the procedural fairness requirements (if applicable), apply the presumption of the reasonableness standard. In Vavilov, the duty of procedural fairness concerned whether reasons for the administrative decision was required and provided (Vavilov at para 78). Having found that reasons were both required and provided in this case, the Supreme Court moves onto its discussion on whether the decision is substantively reasonable. This excerpt from paragraph 81 is also helpful, where the duty of procedural fairness is distinguished from the reasonableness analysis: [\u2026] The starting point for our analysis is therefore that where reasons are required, they are the primary mechanism by which administrative decision makers show that their decisions are reasonable \u2014 both to the affected parties and to the reviewing courts. It follows that the provision of reasons for an administrative decision may have implications for its legitimacy, including in terms both of whether it is procedurally fair and of whether it is substantively reasonable. (Vavilov at para 81) [25] Second, the standard of review to be applied for an H&C immigration officer\u2019s decision is reasonableness, as neither exception from the revised framework applies (Kanthasamy v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61 (CanLII) at para 44 [Kanthasamy]; Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC), [1999] 2 SCR 817 at paras 31 and 56 [Baker]; Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Legault, 2002 FCA 125 (CanLII) at para 15). V. Analysis A. Procedural Fairness [26] The Applicants submit the Officer breached a duty of procedural fairness by considering \u201cextrinsic information that was not disclosed to the Applicants\u201d, which is made in reference to an updated April 2019 version of the USDOS Report on Nigeria. The Applicants argue this document was not in existence at the time the Applicants filed their H&C application, and that the Officer breached procedural fairness by failing to notify the Applicants of the intention to use this information by using the report to make a finding that education would be available to the Minor Applicants. [27] The Respondent submits that cited portions of the updated USDOS Report are materially the same, and that the information acknowledges issues in Nigeria concerning education for female children. The Respondent also submits that the Officer accepted there may be issues faced by female children to obtain education, and that none of the information relied on by the Officer was \u201cnew\u201d or \u201cnovel\u201d. The Respondent points out this information is publicly available, and the Applicants should have been aware of, and could have submitted the updated version in support of their application. [28] In my view, the Officer\u2019s reliance on a publicly available document that is part of the Immigration and Refugee Board\u2019s (\u201cIRB\u201d) National Documentation Package (\u201cNDP\u201d) is not a breach of procedural fairness. Nor is it a breach of procedural fairness for the Officer to not have disclosed the reliance on the NDP (Khokhar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 555 (CanLII) at para 24). [29] The case of Mancia v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 9066 (FCA), [1998] 3 FC 461, is instructive here, where the Court held it is only when an officer relies on a significant post submission document evidencing changes in general country conditions that such a document must be disclosed to an applicant. In the case at bar, the updated USDOS report\u2019s section on education does not contain significant changes in general country conditions that the Officer relied on. Both versions note the impediments to female participation in education in the northern regions of Nigeria, which the officer recognized. Furthermore, although the previous version of the document noted the existence of school fees charged by authorities, I note the Officer\u2019s main concern with the application was the insufficiency of evidence. In fact, the Applicants fleetingly refer to the \u201ceducation system\u201d in Nigeria once in the 7-page H&C submissions (excluding supporting country condition documentation), without even a single sentence on why the Minor Applicants\u2019 best interests would be adversely affected by the education system. [30] Thus, the Officer did not breach procedural fairness. B. Reasonableness (1) Selective Assessment of the Evidence [31] The Applicants submit that the Officer conducted an unreasonable and selective assessment of the evidence. The Applicants note the USDOS Report relied on by the Officer also states that while education is \u201ctechnically free\u201d, there are a multitude of barriers and over 30% of primary school-aged children were not enrolled in formally recognized schools. A report submitted by the Applicants also notes that many children do not attend school due to the need to provide additional income for their families. The Applicants also purport to point out that 60% of Nigerian children younger than age 18 experienced some form of physical, emotional, or sexual violence during childhood. [32] The Applicants rely on Abdulla Farah v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1149 (CanLII) at paras 11-21 [Abdulla Farah] for the proposition that the officer unreasonably ignored the evidence before him. The Applicants also cite Okafor v Citizenship and Immigration (Minister of), 2002 FCT 1108 (CanLII) [Okafor] to support their submission that the Officer erred by referring to the updated NDP. [33] The Respondent submits that the Officer\u2019s decision is reasonable as the impediment to female education is primarily in the northern region of Nigeria, whereas the Applicants would be returning to the southern region. The Officer also noted the Principal Applicant\u2019s employability skills, which would help meet the children\u2019s needs. The Respondent submits that the Officer reasonably found there to be insufficient evidence that the Principal Applicant would be unable to find a similar position when relocating to Nigeria. [34] In my view, the decisions in Abdulla Farah and Okafor are inapplicable to the case at bar. This case does not concern the Officer\u2019s \u201cignoring of evidence\u201d, but concerns the sufficiency of evidence and submissions provided by the Applicants. Therefore, the decision in Abdulla Farah is not instructive for this case. Also, Okafor was a judicial review of the Convention Refugee Determination Division\u2019s decision, not an immigration officer\u2019s decision on an H&C application. Thus, this Court\u2019s decision in Okafor simply does not apply here. [35] As I have noted previously, the Applicants\u2019 H&C submissions consist of a mere seven pages that is lacking in both facts and analysis. Other than providing country condition documentation, the Applicants made no submissions on the BIOC as relating to education, nor its impact on the Minor Applicants. The Applicants broadly stated, \u201cThe prospects for the applicants get even grimmer with the reality of the inadequate health-care system and the near comatose state of the education system.\u201d There are no references to the country documentation in the actual submissions. Furthermore, it is unclear why the Applicants are introducing submissions on the \u201cphysical, emotional, or sexual violence\u201d on children on the application for judicial review. This was not an issue raised in their H&C application. [36] I find the Officer\u2019s decision to be reasonable in this regard. (2) Internal Flight Alternative [37] The Applicants take issue with the Officer\u2019s finding that the Applicants could relocate to Abuja, and submit that the Applicants were not notified that an Internal Flight Alternative (\u201cIFA\u201d) was being considered. However, in the case at bar, there were no submissions on IFA or contrary evidence that would preclude the Officer from concluding that the Applicants could not relocate to Abuja. Given the negligible factual background provided by the Applicants, and \u201chighly discretionary and fact-based nature\u201d of the decision (Baker, para 61), the Officer\u2019s decision was transparent and justified. VI. Certified Question [38] Counsel for each party was asked if there were any questions requiring certification. They each stated that there were no questions for certification and I concur. VII. Conclusion [39] The Officer did not breach procedural fairness in considering an updated USDOS report. The Officer also did not err in the consideration of evidence or of the existence of an IFA in the context of assessing hardship. [40] This application for judicial review is dismissed.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200122 Docket: IMM-3307-19 Citation: 2020 FC 94 Ottawa, Ontario, January 22, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Pamel BETWEEN: DIONETO DE JESUS VUNDA ARMANDO By his litigation guardian MARIA HELENA NHANGA VUNDA Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Nature of the Matter [1] This is an application for judicial review of a decision rendered by the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada on May 7, 2019, which ruled that the applicant was neither a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection within the meaning of sections 96 and 97 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], since he had viable Internal Flight Alternative [IFA] within his country of citizenship, Angola. [2] For the reasons set out below, the present application for judicial review is dismissed. II. Facts [3] The Applicant is now 15 years old from the City of Luanda, Angola, where his parents own and operate a store. The store is located near the Applicant\u2019s school. [4] On May 17, 2017, the store was robbed. The Applicant\u2019s parents reported the theft to the police, and, a week later, the police arrested one of the thieves, who was later released from prison. [5] On October 17, 2017, after leaving school, the Applicant was approached by a gang that included the thief who was arrested, and later released, following the theft at his parents\u2019 store. The gang dragged the Applicant away and tried to kidnap him. The thief threatened the Applicant\u2019s life as revenge for his earlier arrest. Fortunately, a police officer was passing by the area and scared off the gang. The officer escorted the Applicant home. [6] The October 2017 incident was a traumatic experience for the Applicant who since then has feared violent reprisals from the thief, and from the gang generally. The Applicant was afraid to leave the family home or go to school. During this period, his father drove him to and from school. He had a difficult time focusing on his studies, as the thief\u2019s threats and actions occupied his thoughts. The Applicant developed symptoms of depression; his parents grew worried for their child. [7] In an effort to ease the Applicant\u2019s fears, his parents sent him to visit with his aunt in Canada ; his aunt was visiting Angola and was returning to Canada in November 2017. The Applicant arrived in Canada on a temporary visitor\u2019s visa, however, fearing return to Angola at the end of his stay, the Applicant made a claim for refugee protection. [8] The Applicant filled out the relevant forms, in particular his Basis of Claim [BOC], with the assistance of counsel. The Applicant stated in his BOC that he had nightmares and kept remembering the thief\u2019s threats to kill him. The Applicant was afraid of being kidnapped if he were to return to Angola , and feared that the thief and his gang will take revenge against his parents by killing him. III. RPD Decision [9] As the Applicant was a minor, his aunt served as his designated representative at the Refugee Protection Division [RPD] hearing at which his counsel [the RPD Counsel] submitted that the Applicant is in fear of returning, and would remain in fear no matter where he was to live in Angola. [10] On December 21, 2018, the RPD rejected the Applicant\u2019s refugee claim. The RPD made no adverse credibility findings, and accepted the veracity of the Applicant\u2019s story (i.e., the theft at his parent\u2019s store, the subsequent threats, and the threatened kidnapping incident). [11] As regards his claim under section 96 of the IRPA, the RPD found that the Applicant had not established any nexus to one of the grounds enunciated in the Convention. [12] As to the claim under section 97 of the IRPA, the RPD rejected it, having found that the Applicant had three viable IFAs in Angola \u2013 Huambo, Uige, and Luena. In addition, the RPD found that it would be reasonable to expect that the Applicant\u2019s parents would move to join him in one of the IFAs, on the balance of probabilities. [13] In addition, with no psychological assessment having been tendered as evidence addressing the Applicant\u2019s state of mind, the panel was unable to assess how the Applicant\u2019s return to one of the IFAs would affect him. IV. Decision Under Review [14] On appeal before the RAD, the Applicant did not challenge the ruling that his claim failed under section 96 of IRPA. Rather, the Applicant challenged the RPD on three grounds. [15] First, the Applicant argued a breach of procedural fairness in that the RPD failed to follow the Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues [Chairperson Guideline 3] and ignored the procedural protections for minor refugee claimants. In particular, the Applicant argued that the RPD raised the issue of IFAs during the hearing rather than at a pre-hearing conference, without consideration for the Applicant\u2019s status as a minor. [16] Second, the Applicant argued that the RPD committed an error in its IFA finding. In particular, the Applicant argued that the RPD\u2019s approach to the IFA issue was arbitrary because there was no evidence as to why the RPD chose these specific places as IFAs. In addition, the Applicant argued that the RPD ignored evidence showing that the Applicant\u2019s mother is suffering from high blood pressure (hypertension), a condition that (allegedly) requires medical care that is not available outside of Luanda . [17] Third, and in the alternative, the Applicant argued a breach of natural justice on account of the incompetence of his RPD Counsel, particularly with regard to the IFA issue. In essence, the Applicant argued that his RPD Counsel should have addressed the unreasonableness of any IFA in the BOC form, and should have elaborated upon the mother of the Applicant\u2019s medical condition in his written submissions. [18] At the outset of its decision, the RAD accepted new evidence from the Applicant on the issue of his RPD Counsel\u2019s alleged incompetence, as well as evidence relating to his mother\u2019s medical condition and his father\u2019s restrictions as regards finding employment outside of Luanda and the constraints related to him being able to provide for his extended family outside Luanda . [19] On the issue of the RPD Counsel\u2019s incompetence, the Applicant tendered an affidavit from the Applicant\u2019s designated representative, his aunt, which stated that the RPD Counsel did not discuss the possibility of IFAs until the day before the RPD hearing. During this discussion, the Applicant spoke only of the fear that the gang would find him anywhere in Angola . The reasonableness of possible IFAs in Huambo, Uige and Luena was not raised during that discussion. [20] According to the Applicant, had he been better prepared to deal with the issue of viable IFAs, he would have obtained evidence from his parents as to why moving anywhere outside Luanda was not reasonable. [21] The Applicant\u2019s RPD Counsel was given an opportunity to respond to the allegations. He did by stating that he had indeed referred to the IFA in his written submissions and maintained that he asked the Applicant and his designated representative if there were any reasons the Applicant could not live somewhere else in Angola. [22] The RPD counsel also pointed out that he questioned the Applicant about IFAs during the RPD hearing, and claimed that the IFA issue was addressed in the Applicant\u2019s BOC form. [23] In response to the RPD Counsel\u2019s submissions, the Applicant\u2019s aunt, as his designated representative, submitted a further affidavit in reply stating that it was her understanding that the RPD Counsel only asked for documentation pertaining to dangers and risks associated with moving to the identified IFAs (being the first prong of the IFA test) and not in respect to the reasonableness of the any possible IFAs prior to the RPD hearing. [24] The aunt also attached a medical statement con\ufb01rming the applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s hypertension condition, and a declaration from the Applicant\u2019s father explaining that he would not be able to economically provide for his extended family in the event of a relocation. [25] Before the RAD, the Applicant argued that he would have provided additional documentary evidence as to his mother\u2019s health condition, in particular the availability of emergency services in the IFAs, and his family\u2019s inability to support his family elsewhere in Angola . To the Applicant, the inability to do so undermined the reasonableness of the RPD decision. [26] On May 7, 2019, the RAD dismissed the appeal. [27] Regarding the first ground of appeal, the RAD found that the RPD was aware of the Chairperson Guideline 3 and accommodated the minor Applicant accordingly. [28] Regarding the IFA analysis, the RAD concluded that the RPD did not commit an error in finding that the Applicant had three IFAs in Angola . In addition, the RAD found that it was reasonable to conclude that the parents would relocate with the Applicant within Angola , taking into consideration the family\u2019s situation. [29] Although the RAD accepted that the RPD Counsel could have been more effective in addressing the IFA issue, Counsel\u2019s conduct did not amount to incompetence. In any event, the RAD found that a miscarriage of justice did not take place because even on the strength of the new evidence submitted by the Applicant, his claim would have been rejected regardless of any shortcomings on the part of the RPD Counsel. V. Issues [30] This case raises three issues: Was there a breach of natural justice on account of RPD Counsel\u2019s conduct? Was the RAD\u2019s decision as to the IFAs reasonable? Was there a lack of procedural fairness on account of a failure to properly apply the Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants? VI. Standard of Review [31] Before me, both counsel agreed that the standard of review is one of reasonableness (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov]). I agree, as I see no reason to overturn the presumption that reasonableness is the applicable standard in this case (Vavilov at para 23). [32] In his submission, however, counsel for the Applicant stressed that Vavilov also provides insight on how to assess whether a decision is unreasonable. In particular, the Applicant asked that I keep in mind that reasonableness review: entails a \u201csensitive and respectful, but robust, evaluation of administrative decisions\u201d (Vavilov at para 12); \u201cfocuses on justification\u201d (Vavilov at para 74); focuses on whether the reasons explain the \u201chow and why a decision was made\u201d so as to show \u201caffected parties that their arguments have been considered\u201d (Vavilov at para 79); requires the court to consider whether the decision, including its \u201crationale\u201d and the \u201coutcome,\u201d was unreasonable (Vavilov at para 83); requires the court to examine the reasons with \u201crespectful attention\u201d so as to seek to understand the reasoning process of the decision maker (Vavilov at para 84); looks to whether the decision is justified on the basis of the \u201creasoning process\u201d and analysis (Vavilov at paras 86 and 87); includes an enquiry as to whether there are \u201cserious shortcomings in the decision\u201d which are \u201csufficiently central or significant\u201d so as to render the decision unreasonable (Vavilov at para 100); and allows a court to be determine whether it is satisfied that there is a \u201cline of analysis\u201d in \u201cthe reasons that could reasonably lead\u201d \u201cfrom the evidence\u201d \u201cto the conclusion\u201d (Vavilov at para 102). [33] In addition, the Applicant submits that reasonableness may be questioned where there has been a fundamental misapprehension of the evidence or where that decision-maker has failed to account for such evidence (Vavilov at para 126), or whether there has been a failure by the decision maker to grapple with \u201ckey issues or central arguments\u201d of the parties (Vavilov at para 128). [34] Having considered the arguments of the Applicant as to elements of what may constitute an unreasonable decision, I find that the Applicant has not met his burden of convincing me that the RAD decision was unreasonable (Vavilov at para 100; Soultani Kanawati v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 12 at para 11). For the reasons set out below, the present application is, therefore, dismissed. VII. Discussion (1) Was the RAD\u2019s decision as to the IFAs reasonable? [35] I will address this issue first, as it is determinative. [36] The Rasaratnam v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 FC 706 at 710 and Thirunavukkarasu v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1994] 1 FC 589, cases propounded a two-prong test to be applied in determining whether there is a viable IFA. [37] The two-prong IFA test requires that: (i) there is no serious possibility of the individual being persecuted in the IFA area (on the balance of probabilities); and (ii) conditions in the proposed IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances for an individual to seek refuge there (Reci v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 833 at para 19; Titcombe v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1346 at para 15). [38] Both prongs must be satisfied for a finding that the claimant has an IFA. This two-prong test ensures that Canada complies with international norms regarding IFAs (UNHCR Guidelines on International Protection: \u201cInternal Flight or Relocation Alternative\u201d within the Context of Article 1A (2) of the 1951 Convention and/or 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees, HCR/GIP/03/04, 23 July 2003 at paras 7, 24-30). [39] In its decision, the RAD confirmed the RPD\u2019s finding that the Applicant has safe and reasonable IFAs in both Uige and Huambo. [40] The Applicant concedes that the first prong of the IFA test is met, but argues that the RAD\u2019s analysis of the second prong of the IFA was unreasonable as it committed a reviewable error in failing to address documentary evidence showing that his mother would not receive adequate care for her medical condition outside of Luanda . In addition, the Applicant submits that the RAD did not address evidence showing that his father would not be able to provide for the family in the event of a relocation. [41] Admittedly, the evidence before the RPD in respect to the reasonableness of the proposed IFAs, and the RPD Counsel\u2019s focus on that issue during the RPD hearing, was far from extensive, and I accept that there is an argument to be made that more could have been done to address the issue of an IFA. [42] However, the Applicant\u2019s new counsel was successful in having the RAD admit two new pieces of evidence which, he argued, could have been put before the RPD had the RPD Counsel performed his duties appropriately; the first being a report from a doctor in Luanda confirming that the Applicant\u2019s mother was suffering from hypertension, and the second being a statement from the Applicant\u2019s father, a practising lawyer, suggesting that he would not be able to practise law outside of Luanda, because \u201cpeople from other provinces, besides not having the money to pay a lawyer, most of the conflicts there are treated by traditional authorities and there is no positive law.\u201d [43] No other reason is given by the father as to why he would not be able to work outside of Luanda, however, the father does also mention in his statement that he is supporting five siblings and three nephews, in addition to his immediate family. [44] The Applicant\u2019s argument is not that these two new pieces of evidence definitively establish that the IFAs are unreasonable, but rather that the RAD failed to properly assess and take into consideration those documents in its analysis on reasonability of the IFAs, thus rendering its decision unreasonable. [45] As I stated in Sbayti v Canada (Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2019 FC 1296 at paragraph 60 [Sbayti], where \u201cthere is a fundamental issue going to the crux of the matter, reference should be made to any credible document that deals with that matter head on.\u201d In Begum v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 409 [Begum], M. Justice Russell, stated the following at paragraph 81: According to relevant jurisprudence, this Court may infer that a decision-maker has made an erroneous finding of fact without regard to the evidence from a failure to mention in the reasons evidence that is relevant to the finding and which points to a different conclusion: Cepeda-Guiterrez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1998] FCJ No 1425 at para 15. Such errors made without regard to the evidence and which significantly affect the decision justify judicial intervention, even if it is not obvious that those errors were made in a perverse or capricious fashion: Maqsood v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] FCJ No 1699 at para 18. This Court has also found that the IAD cannot overlook key evidence that contradicts its findings without addressing such contradictory evidence; if such evidence is not referred to, it will be assumed to have been ignored: Ivanov v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 1055 at para 23. [Emphasis added.] [46] In his written submissions before the RAD, Applicant\u2019s counsel argued that the medical report confirms the aunt\u2019s testimony before the RPD regarding his mother\u2019s hypertension, and suggests that it therefore follows that emergency health care is not available to the mother outside of Luanda. [47] As to the father\u2019s explanation of not being able to provide for his family outside of Luanda, counsel argues that a law practice in the provincial capitals could not provide adequately for the father to continue to support not only his family, but his extended family as well. [48] Nothing further is said as regards both issues. [49] In arriving at its decision on the viability of the IFAs, the RAD considered the reasonableness of relocation in the light of the circumstances of the Applicant\u2019s parents: In relation to reasonableness, the circumstances of the Appellant\u2019s parents do need to be taken into account. There is nothing in the Appellant's submissions that addresses the fact that both of the Appellant\u2018s parents are educated and thus, although it would be inconvenient to restart their careers, is not suf\ufb01cient to show undue hardship. I note the argument also made regarding the Appellant\u2019s mother\u2018s hypertension, but find that this is not a sufficient reason that the family as a whole cannot relocate, and does not address the father\u2018s ability to provide income for the family. [50] Much like the RPD, the RAD found that the Applicant\u2019s parents would not experience undue hardship in the event of a relocation. While relocation may involve an inconvenience or a career change for his parents, the Applicant did not provide evidence that relocation would provoke an undue hardship that exceeds the threshold of reasonability under the second prong of the IFA test. [51] I agree with the Applicant that the RAD did not specifically mention the medical report, nor the father\u2019s statement. However, unlike the situation in Sbayti, this is a case where the Applicant must overcome a strong presumption of reasonableness as to a finding of the RAD. I am not convinced that he has been successful, even with the new evidence. [52] The RAD assessed the new evidence and submissions on behalf of the Applicant in relation to the reasonableness of IFAs. As stated by the RAD in the context of its determination regarding the competence of the RPD Counsel: Furthermore, for reasons I will discuss in the IFA section below, I find that the arguments advanced by the RAD Counsel (in relation to the reasonableness of the IFAs) are also not particularly persuasive, and that if the RPD Counsel advanced these arguments in submissions, the result would have been the same. [Emphasis added.] [53] As to the mother\u2019s medical report, although I agree that it corroborates the aunt\u2019s testimony before the RPD that the Applicant\u2019s mother is suffering from hypertension, it does not say much else; in particular, it does not address her ongoing medical needs other than saying she must be followed by a cardiologist. By making no specific mention of the available follow-up care in any of the IFAs, the report does not establish that the mother cannot receive care in those areas. [54] There is also no evidence that the mother requires emergency care, as opposed to a simple plan of action to address her condition and provide for regular follow-up examinations by her physician. [55] The Applicant\u2019s counsel also concedes that there is nothing in the report that suggests that the mother\u2019s hypertension may lead to a stroke, or that she needs to be in a location where emergency medical services are available, but asks that the Court make that inference so as to read in the requirement that the mother needs to be in an area where such emergency services are available. [56] As to the lack of emergency medical treatment outside of Luanda , the Applicant points to a 2018 U.S. Department of State - Overseas Security Advisory Council report suggesting that adequate care for serious medical emergencies in Angola is limited to Luanda . However, without any medical report confirming the mother\u2019s need to be close to emergency facilities and that her hypertension cannot be reasonably managed by medication, I do not see how I can leap to the conclusion that the Applicant is asking me to make, even assuming such emergency medical care would not be available in the IFAs. [57] The evidence does not show that the mother\u2019s medical condition requires emergency medical care, and the RAD drew a reasonable conclusion regarding the possibility of undue hardship related to a relocation. [58] As to the father\u2019s statement asserting his inability to make a living outside of Luanda , I must admit I find it quite unconvincing. As I suggested to counsel during the hearing, although the father expresses reasons why he feels it would be more difficult for him to practise law outside of Luanda (without specifically mentioning the IFAs), it does not follow that he would not be able to practise at all, or not be able to find some other form of employment to support his family, siblings and nephews in the event they found it necessary to move from Luanda. [59] As confirmed by the Applicant\u2019s counsel, the father is not saying in his statement that there are no lawyers outside of Luanda , but only that there is less work for lawyers. The Applicant\u2019s counsel concedes that this is not enough to justify a finding of unreasonableness as to the IFAs. [60] He adds, however, that the father is not simply providing for his immediate family, but in addition, as he states, also has five siblings and three nephews under his care and responsibility, and that this is a factor that could lead to a finding that relocating to the IFAs would be unreasonable. [61] There is no evidence offered as regards to the mother\u2019s employment prospects or her ability to open up another boutique in the IFAs. [62] In Adebayo v Canada (Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2019 FC 330 [Adebayo], Madam Justice Kane cited Ranganathan (at para 15) for the proposition that there is a high onus on a refugee claimant to demonstrate that a proposed IFA is unreasonable, requiring \u201cnothing less than the existence of conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of a claimant in travelling or temporarily relocating to a safe area\u201d and that such conditions are \u201cin sharp contrast with undue hardship resulting from loss of employment, loss of status, reduction in quality of life [\u2026]\u201d (at para 51). Madam Justice Kane made it clear that this high threshold applies to both prongs of the IFA test (Adebayo at par. 53). [63] The Applicant seeks to distinguish Adebayo: he submits that the IFA in that case was a large urban city, where the applicant\u2019s language was spoken and with large communities that practised the applicant\u2019s faith. In contract, the present case goes beyond the simple hardship of finding work in a different city, but includes evidence that the father was supporting a large extended family. [64] I must say that unless the Applicant is suggesting that I should consider the hardship of the extended family members in determining the reasonableness of the IFA (which I do not believe he is), I cannot see how this distinction is relevant. In the end, it is a matter of economic hardship one way or the other, whether one focuses on the Applicant, the parents, or the extended family. [65] I conclude that the Applicant has failed to meet the high threshold set out in Adebayo, and that the RAD\u2019s analysis and conclusions on the viability of IFAs were not unreasonable. Although the analysis of the new evidence was somewhat cursory, there was not much evidence for the RAD to discuss in its review. I can certainly see from the medical report and father\u2019s statement evidence supporting the RAD\u2019s conclusions, and although I appreciate that Vavilov (at paras 81, 97) cautioned against focusing only on outcomes in the determination of reasonableness, I find that the RAD did follow a process that met the requirements of a proper reasonableness review. [66] On the whole, I find that the decision of the RAD allows the reader to understand its reasoning process (Vavilov at para 84), and that its line of analysis does reasonably lead from the evidence to the conclusion (Vavilov at para 102). I do not see anything in the RAD decision to conclude that there were shortcomings that were \u201csufficiently central or significant\u201d so as to render the decision unreasonable (Vavilov at para 100). [67] Nor do I think that the reasonableness of the decision has been jeopardized because of a fundamental misapprehension of the evidence or because the RAD has failed to account for such evidence (Vavilov at para 126), or because the RAD failed to grapple with key issues or central arguments of the parties (Vavilov at para 128). Although specific reference to the mother\u2019s medical report and the father\u2019s statement were not made, it seems to me that the conclusions of the RAD could easily accommodate those documents given their shortcomings \u2013 something which was not possible in Sbayti. (2) Was there a breach of natural justice on account of the RPD Counsel\u2019s conduct? [68] Given my decision that the RAD\u2019s determination of the IFAs was not unreasonable, I need not consider the issue of RPD Counsel\u2019s incompetence. In any event, the Applicant made his argument in the alternative. [69] It is conceded by the Applicant that this would only have been an issue if I had concluded that the new evidence that was put before the RAD could reasonably form the basis of undue hardship and thus the RPD had reached an unreasonable conclusion as to the IFAs. [70] Consequently, the matter of the conduct of RPD Counsel seems now to be somewhat moot. The RAD reviewed the matter and made its own finding as to the reasonableness of the IFAs based upon the new evidence, evidence which arguably could have been brought forward before the RPD by RPD Counsel. [71] I would say, however, that this Court holds a high standard in finding a counsel to be incompetent (Huynh v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1993), 65 FT 11 at 15 (TD); Pathinathar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 1225 at para 38 [Pathinathar]). [72] In Hamdan v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2017 FC 643 at paragraphes 36-38, Chief Justice Crampton set forth a two-part test for a finding of counsel incompetence regarding representation before the RPD (citing R v GDB, 2000 SCC 22 at paras 26-29. [73] First, the applicant must establish that the RPD Counsel\u2019s acts or omissions constituted incompetence. Second, the acts or omission must result in a miscarriage of justice. [74] In Gombos, Madam Justice Strickland summarized the law concerning counsel competency at the RPD stage and ruled that the applicant had the burden to provide sufficient evidence to satisfy both parts of the test (at para 17). [75] Having considered the Applicant\u2019s submissions, suffice it to say, that I have not been convinced by the Applicant that this case involves the type of exceptional circumstances that warrant a finding of incompetency on the part of the Applicant\u2019s former counsel leading to a determination of a breach of natural justice (Pathinathar at para 43). (3) Was there a lack of procedural fairness on account of the failure to properly apply the Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants? [76] Neither party made any oral submissions during the hearing before me on this issue, but relied solely on their written submissions. [77] The Applicant submits that the RPD failed to adhere to the Chairperson Guideline 3 and thus breached the rules of procedural fairness, by not adhering to mid-hearing conferences given the absence of IFA being addressed in the BOC. [78] The Respondent insists that the use of conferences is discretionary under the Chairperson Guideline 3. The Respondent argues that the Applicant has not shown how a mid-hearing conference would have affected the outcome of the decision. [79] Neither party cited cases in support of their arguments on this point. [80] The Chairperson Guideline 3 provides guiding principles on the protection of child refugee claimants that are consistent with international norms such as United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (Kim v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 149 at paras 7-9 [Kim]; Bukvic v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 638 at para 28; Andrade v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2015 FC 1007 at para 13). [81] The Chairperson Guideline 3 requires that decision-makers give due consideration to the applicants\u2019 age or best interests and provides special rules for the representation of minors, the processing of refugee protection claims for unaccompanied minors and the elicitation and evaluation of evidence (Douillard v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 390 at para 27; Homaire v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1197 at para 50; Kim at paras 7-9, 76; Henry v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 1084 at para 50 [Henry]). Indeed, due consideration to the procedural constraints contained in the Chairperson Guideline 3 is an indicator of reasonability (Tambadou v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1042 at paras 25-27; Henry at para 50). [82] However, in this case, any supposed shortcomings on the part of the RPD to convene pre- or mid-hearing conferences on the issue of IFAs were corrected by the RAD having accepted the new evidence which, arguably, should have been put before the RPD. The issue of incompetence on the part of the RPD Counsel is now moot; for the same reasons, so is the issue pertaining to the alleged non-consideration by the RPD of the Chairperson Guideline 3. VIII. Conclusion [1] Having found that the decision of the RAD in relation to the availability of viable IFAs is not unreasonable, I dismiss the application for judicial review. The parties did not submit a question for certification, and none arose. JUDGMENT in IMM-3307-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question for certification. \"Peter G.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200110 Docket: IMM-2961-19 Citation: 2020 FC 31 Ottawa, Ontario, January 10, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Roy BETWEEN: KAMALJEET KAUR SAGGU Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS [1] This judicial review application, made pursuant to section 72 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, S.C. 2001, c 27 [IRPA], is concerned with a decision made by an officer regarding an application made for a work permit and restoration of temporary residence status. [2] The formal decision itself fits in one paragraph: Foreign students in Canada are eligible for a work permit for post-graduation employment if they submit an application within 90 days of issuance of notification that they have successfully completed all of the requirements for their course of studies or program. As your application was not mailed within the prescribed period of time, it has been determined that you are not eligible for a work permit in this category. The decision letter goes on to state that the applicant is without status and is therefore required to leave Canada immediately. [3] The Global Case Management System (GCMS) notes, which are part of the decision (Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817, para 44), flesh out somehow the reasons for the decision. The following is taken from the one paragraph appearing in the GCMS notes: Client has failed to comply with the condition imposed under R185(a) to leave Canada by 18/12 / 18. As per A47(a) temporary resident status has been lost. Has applied for and is eligible for restoration under R182. WP refused as per R205(c)(ii). Client is requesting a PGWP [Post-Graduation Work Permit], having provided education transcripts and letter of completion from Douglas College indicating client completed the 2 year \u2018Computer and Information Systems \u2019 post-baccalaureate diploma as of 2018/ 08 / 24. PGWP eligibility requirements stipulate a client\u2019s request for C43 consideration must be made within 90 days of completing program of study. Appears client\u2019s request for C43 consideration was made after allotted 90 day eligibility period, as application was received 2019/ 01 / 24. Basically, the decision is that in order to satisfy the requirement for obtaining a Post-Graduation Work Permit, such application must be made within 90 days of completing the program of study. Given that the program was completed on August 24, 2018, the application had to be made within 90 days of that date. Since the application was received on January 24, 2019, well passed the 90-day window, the application was denied. [4] A chronology of events may be of assistance in understanding this case: August 13, 2015: Ms. Saggu entered into Canada as an international student on a study permit; August 24, 2018: Ms. Saggu graduates with a two-year diploma in Computer and Information System from Douglas College; September 10, 2018: a letter from the Office of the Registrar states that Ms. Saggu completed all program requirements to graduate with the two-year post-baccalaureate diploma in Computer and Information System as of August 24, 2018; October 12, 2018: Ms. Saggu applies for a Post-Graduate Work Permit; December 18, 2018: Ms. Saggu\u2019s application for a Post-Graduate Work Permit is refused by an officer of the Case Processing Centre of Vegreville, because she did not submit the required documentation regarding completion of studies; January 12, 2019, Ms. Saggu applies for a Post-Graduate Work Permit and Restoration of Status; January 24, 2019: Ms. Saggu\u2019s application for C43 consideration is received by the respondent; April 26, 2019: Ms. Saggu\u2019s application for a Work Permit and Restauration of Temporary Residence Status is refused by an officer at the Case Processing Center of Edmonton. [5] Fundamentally, Ms. Saggu\u2019s PGWP (Post-Graduation Work Permit) application was refused because her request was made after the 90-day eligibility period. Instead, the complete application was received 153 days after she had completed her study program, on August 24, 2018. The applicant argues the unfairness of a system applied without any flexibility, arguing that she should benefit from a change to the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program, which was published on February 14, 2019. More particularly, the applicant claims that she is entitled to a period of 180 days from the educational institution indicating that she has met the requirements for completing the program of study. If that were the case, her second application would be well within the 180-day window (second application having been made on January 24, 2019). [6] In support of her claim, the applicant relies heavily on the nature of the policy change of February 14, 2019, which was intended to be a facilitative measure. Furthermore, the officer ought to have accepted a flexible approach in view of the purpose of the change, which was to facilitate such applications. Indeed, the applicant alleges that the officer had discretion, which should have been exercised in favour of the applicant, especially in view of the fact that a first application had been made well within the 90 days that were then enforced prior to February 14, 2019. Finally, the applicant asserts that the way the policy was applied constitutes a form of retroactivity, or retrospectivity of the old rule instead of applying the new window of 180 days. [7] Unfortunately for the applicant, she does not account for the important note spelled out on the front page of the Post Graduation Work Permit Program, which is to be found as exhibit A to the affidavit of Vivian Yiu of July 9, 2019. As a matter of fact, the applicant did not dispute the existence of the very significant note which reads: Important note: the following guidelines are effective for all post-graduation work permit applications received on or after February 14, 2019. The previous guidelines apply to all applications received before February 14, 2019. Post-graduation work permit applicants who have been refused the work permit based on the previous guidelines may submit a new application under the new guidelines, effective February 14, 2019, if they are eligible to apply. [Bold in original.] [8] If the first sentence in the paragraph could perhaps be read by some as leaving some ambiguity, the second sentence cannot be, in my view, any clearer: \u201cThe previous guidelines apply to all applications received before February 14, 2019\u201d. It follows that the applicant\u2019s argument collapses. Instructions are given to immigration officials to apply the 90-day window where the applications for the work permit is made prior to February 14, 2019. That is the situation with which the applicant is faced in this case. [9] It cannot be said that the officer enjoyed a discretion that does not exist. There is no interpretation that can be given, using the purpose of the policy to facilitate the applications, the language used (in both official languages) and the context simply because the policy is remarkably clear. The suggestion that the applicant had a legitimate expectation against retroactive or retrospective application of the old policy is simply inappropriate. There is no retroactive effect as the policy declares that the rules that existed prior to February 14, 2019 apply to the applications that were made prior to February 14, 2019. In effect, the Minister instructs his officials to operate in a particular way and the official in this case simply applied the policy as it was intended. For retroactivity, or retrospectivity, to operate, it would have been for the new policy, that which came into effect after February 14, 2019, to apply retrospectively to fact situations prior to that date. The fact that a first application had been denied within the 90-day period does not change the fact that the new application was well outside the 90 period. [10] The existence of the new policy with its restriction as to the time period was known to the applicant in July 2019. The respondent\u2019s factum is based on the program delivery instructions of February 14, 2019, with its clear cut off date. There was not in the submissions offered on behalf of the applicant any argument to counter the statement in the policy. In fact, nothing was challenged. [11] The absence of discretion and the need to follow the program delivery instructions has been applied by this Court in a number of cases. The case of Nookala v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1019 (and its progeny: Osahor v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 666; Kaur v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 572; Ofori v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 212) established the principle. At paragraph 12, Madam Justice Mactavish, then of this Court, stated: [12] The Program document at issue in this case establishes criteria that must be satisfied for a candidate to qualify for a Post-Graduation Work Permit. While the Program document also provides information and guidance as to how the program is to be administered, nothing in the document confers any discretion on immigration officers to modify or waive the Program\u2019s eligibility requirements. Consequently, no fettering of discretion occurred when the immigration officer determined that Mr. Nookala was required to hold a valid study permit in order for him to be eligible for a Post-Graduation Work Permit. [Italics in original.] [12] I have reviewed the decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, 2019 SCC 65, which makes adjustments to the framework to be applied in administrative law cases. The Supreme Court confirmed that the standard of review is presumptively reasonableness. That is the standard applied in this case. Furthermore, the Court provided guidance on what makes a decision lacking in reasonableness. In the case at hand, the text of the policy was remarkably clear and it was applied, as it should. [13] In the absence of any argument to the contrary, the Court has no choice but to follow this well-established jurisprudence of our Court. Accordingly, the judicial review application must be dismissed. The parties are in agreement that there is no question to be certified in accordance with section 74 of IRPA. JUDGMENT in IMM-2961-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The judicial review application is dismissed. There is no serious question of general importance that ought to be certified. \u201cYvan Roy\u201d Judge FEDERAL COURT SOLICITORS OF RECORD DOCKET: IMM-2961-19 STYLE OF CAUSE: KAMALJEET KAUR SAGGU v THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION PLACE OF HEARING: TORONTO, ONTARIO DATE OF HEARING: DECEMBER 18, 2019 JUDGMENT AND REASONS: ROY J.

The Proceeding [1] This application is for judicial review of a decision of the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board dated March 14, 2019 [the Decision], in which the panel member [the Member] dismissed the Applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that the Applicant\u2019s claim for refugee protection, which was based on a fear of persecution in Bangladesh for being gay, was not credible. This application was brought pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [the IRPA]. [2] The Applicant is a 47-year-old male citizen of Bangladesh. In February 2001, he flew to New York hoping to settle there. He got a one month visa, overstayed it, and started working as a sales representative. He lived in New York City for 17 years and described his gay lifestyle there. Yet he made a fraudulent claim for asylum in the US based only on an alleged political opinion. [3] The RPD rejected his identity as a gay man and in the Decision, the RAD upheld that finding. II. The Issue [4] The Applicant says that the Decision is internally inconsistent in that it appears to say in paragraphs 35 and 37 that the RAD accepts that the Applicant is gay and yet concludes otherwise in paragraph 54. However, I am not persuaded that there is an inconsistency. In paragraphs 36 and 37 the RAD is relating the Applicant\u2019s evidence about his lifestyle in New York. The RAD provided this description to meet its obligation under the Sexual Orientation and Gender Guidelines to consider the Applicant\u2019s cultural background. [5] It is clear that the RAD did not make a finding that the Applicant led a gay lifestyle in New York because it does not use the word \u201cfinding\u201d. When the RAD makes findings throughout the Decision it does so in clear terms using the word \u201cfinding\u201d. [6] No question was posed for certification for appeal. JUDGMENT IN IMM-2192-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that the application for judicial review is dismissed. \"Sandra J.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200113 Docket: IMM-1201-19 Citation: 2020 FC 38 Ottawa, Ontario, January 13, 2020 PRESENT: Madam Justice Walker BETWEEN: SHAHIN MIAH Applicant and THE MINISTER OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] Mr. Shahin Miah is a citizen of Bangladesh who came to Canada in 2017 and made a claim for refugee protection. In a decision (Decision) dated January 29, 2019, the Immigration Division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board found that Mr. Miah was inadmissible to Canada on security grounds pursuant to paragraphs 34(1)(c) and 34(1)(f) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 (IRPA). The basis of the Decision was two-fold. The ID concluded that (1) Mr. Miah was a member of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) from 2005 to 2017; and (2) there were reasonable grounds to believe that the BNP engages, has engaged or will engage in acts of terrorism through its use of hartals to further its political goals. Mr. Miah contests both of the ID\u2019s conclusions and seeks judicial review of the Decision pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the IRPA. [2] For the reasons that follow, the application will be dismissed. II. Background [3] Mr. Miah joined the BNP on April 28, 2005 as a general member, attending meetings and political rallies. He was promoted within the BNP to the position of General Secretary of his local ward in 2007. His responsibilities in that role were humanitarian in nature. These facts are not in dispute. [4] Mr. Miah alleges that he was targeted for persecution and harassment by members of the BNP\u2019s political rival, the Awami League (AL), from 2009 to 2014. He states that he was kidnapped and severely beaten in 2009 by AL members and went into hiding following the attack, moving between his parents\u2019 and sisters\u2019 houses to avoid further violence as AL members continued to look for him. [5] Mr. Miah left Bangladesh on August 9, 2014. He travelled through a number of countries and arrived in the United States on December 11, 2014. He claimed asylum in the U.S. but his claim was denied on July 2, 2015. [6] Mr. Miah remained in the U.S. following the adverse asylum determination until he entered Canada on July 2, 2017 and made a refugee claim. He was interviewed by an officer of the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) on August 11, 2017. [7] On September 19, 2017, the CBSA officer prepared a report regarding Mr. Miah under subsection 44(1) of the IRPA. The officer concluded that Mr. Miah is inadmissible to Canada pursuant to paragraph 34(1)(f) of the IRPA due to his membership in the BNP, an organization that there were reasonable grounds to believe engaged in acts of subversion of the Government of Bangladesh (paragraphs 34(1)(b) and (b.1) of the IRPA) and in acts of terrorism (paragraph 34(1)(c) of the IRPA). [8] On October 4, 2017, the Minister\u2019s delegate referred Mr. Miah\u2019s case to the ID for an admissibility hearing pursuant to subsection 44(2) of the IRPA. Mr. Miah\u2019s claim for refugee protection was suspended pending the ID\u2019s determination of his inadmissibility. [9] The ID held an admissibility hearing on October 23, 2018 and issued the Decision on January 29, 2019. Mr. Miah filed this application for judicial review of the Decision on February 20, 2019. III. Decision Under Review [10] The ID concluded that Mr. Miah is inadmissible to Canada as a person described in paragraph 34(1)(f) of the IRPA due to his membership in the BNP and its involvement in acts of terrorism. The Minister did not pursue the issue of whether the BNP had engaged in acts of subversion in his arguments before the ID. As a result, the ID did not address the application of paragraphs 34(1)(b) and (b.1) to the BNP\u2019s activities. The Minister\u2019s arguments, and the ID\u2019s Decision, focussed on the duration of Mr. Miah\u2019s membership in the BNP and the question of whether the BNP was an organization engaged or engaging in terrorism within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(c) of the IRPA. [11] The ID found that Mr. Miah was a member of the BNP from April 2005 until at least August 2017, the date of his CBSA interview. The panel did not accept Mr. Miah\u2019s submission that he had ceased to be a BNP member at the end of 2011 and, therefore, that he was not a member during the 2012-2014 campaigns of violence incited by the BNP. The ID found that Mr. Miah had made statements to Canadian and U.S. immigration authorities in 2014 and 2017 regarding his continued BNP membership and rejected his explanations of those prior contradictory statements. [12] Having established Mr. Miah\u2019s membership, the ID turned to the BNP\u2019s alleged involvement in acts of terrorism. The panel reviewed the recent jurisprudence of this Court regarding the BNP and the discussions in those cases of the appropriate definition of \u201cterrorism\u201d for purposes of subsection 34(1)(c) of the IRPA. The ID concluded that it would rely on the definition set forth by the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) in Suresh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1 (Suresh). [13] The ID first reviewed the use of hartals generally by political parties in Bangladesh and their evolution from general strikes to protests that are synonymous with violence. The ID also reviewed the BNP\u2019s historical connection with the use of violence, its well-documented and repeated calling of hartals to protest the 2014 general election, and the scope of the violence by BNP members during the hartals. The panel stated that the violence included the \u201ckilling of people who refused to honour the blockades, attacking democratic institutions, such as polling stations and election officials and throwing petrol bombs at buses and vehicles\u201d. The panel concluded that the actions taken by the perpetrators of those attacks amounted to terrorism. [14] The ID referred to this Court\u2019s decision in Rana v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 1080 (Rana), and the presence of an intention to cause death or serious bodily harm by the use of violence as crucial in determining if an act or acts constitute terrorism within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(c). The panel found that the predictable consequence of calling a hartal was the use of violence and that it was difficult to conclude that BNP leaders did not know that civilian deaths and serious bodily harm would result from the hartals. The ID concluded that it was not plausible that the BNP, in calling hartals during the 2012-2014 election period, did not intend to achieve its political ends through violence. [15] The ID found that the essential elements of the definition of terrorism set out in Suresh had been met and that the BNP had engaged in acts that correspond to terrorism within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(c) of the IRPA. The panel confirmed the subsection 44(1) report and determined that Mr. Miah is inadmissible to Canada. IV. Issues [16] Mr. Miah raises the following issues in this application: Did the ID reasonably conclude that Mr. Miah was a member of the BNP from April 2005 until at least August 2017? Was the ID\u2019s finding that the BNP engaged in acts that fall within the definition of terrorism pursuant to paragraph 34(1)(c) of the IRPA reasonable? V. Standard of Review [17] On December 19, 2019, the SCC rendered its decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 (Vavilov), establishing the presumptive standard of review of an administrative decision as reasonableness (Vavilov at para 10). None of the situations identified by the SCC for departing from the presumption apply here and, accordingly, I have reviewed the Decision for reasonableness. The majority in Vavilov also set out guidance for reviewing courts on the application of the reasonableness standard drawing on prior jurisprudence, notably Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 (Dunsmuir). I have applied that guidance in my review, exercising restraint but conducting a robust review of the Decision for justification and internal coherence (Vavilov at paras 12-15, 85-86; see also Canada Post Corp. v Canada Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67 at paras 28-29 (Canada Post))). [18] The standard of review of a decision regarding inadmissibility under subsection 34(1) of the IRPA was reasonableness under the pre\u2011December 19, 2019 jurisprudence (Saleheen v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 145 at para 24 (Saleheen); SA v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 FC 494 at para 9). On the facts of this case, I am satisfied that there is no need to request additional submissions from the parties on either the appropriate standard of review or the application of that standard (Vavilov at para 144). My conclusions in this judgment would have been the same under the Dunsmuir framework (Canada Post at para 24). [19] I note that the facts giving rise to inadmissibility must be established on the standard of \u201creasonable grounds to believe\u201d (section 33 of the IRPA). On judicial review, my role is not to determine whether there were reasonable grounds to believe Mr. Miah is inadmissible pursuant to paragraph 34(1)(f) of the IRPA; rather, my role is to determine whether the ID\u2019s finding that there were \u2018reasonable grounds to believe\u2019 was itself reasonable (Rana at para 21; Rahaman v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 947 at para 9). VI. Applicable Legislative Provisions [20] Paragraphs 34(1)(c) and (f) of the IRPA provide as follows: 34 (1) A permanent resident or a foreign national is inadmissible on security grounds for 34 (1) Emportent interdiction de territoire pour raison de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 les faits suivants : \u2026 [\u2026] (c) engaging in terrorism; c) se livrer au terrorisme; \u2026 [\u2026] (f) being a member of an organization that there are reasonable grounds to believe engages, has engaged or will engage in acts referred to in paragraph (a), (b), (b.1) or (c). f) \u00eatre membre d\u2019une organisation dont il y a des motifs raisonnables de croire qu\u2019elle est, a \u00e9t\u00e9 ou sera l\u2019auteur d\u2019un acte vis\u00e9 aux alin\u00e9as a), b), b.1) ou c). VII. Analysis 1. Did the ID reasonably conclude that Mr. Miah was a member of the BNP from April 2005 until at least August 2017? [21] Mr. Miah submits that he ceased to be a member of the BNP in 2012 when he did not renew his membership and went into hiding until his departure from Bangladesh in 2014. He argues that the ID unreasonably concluded that he continued to be a BNP member until August 2017 and erred in finding that his explanations of his prior contradictory statements were not credible. [22] The ID made four findings in determining that Mr. Miah\u2019s BNP membership extended to August 2017: (1) The ID relied on the admissions made by Mr. Miah at the admissibility hearing on October 23, 2018. The panel found that Mr. Miah had confirmed the admissions made on his behalf by counsel, specifically that, during his interview with the CBSA officer on August 11, 2017, he declared that \u201che is a member of the BNP since April 28, 2005\u2026\u201d. (2) During the August 2017 CBSA interview, Mr. Miah was asked about his membership in the BNP. The transcript of the interview reads as follows Q- In your Basis of Claim form, you declared to be a member of the Bangladesh National Party, known as the BNP. Is this correct? A- Yes Q- Are you still a member of the Bangladesh National Party, today? A- Yes. The ID stated in the Decision that Mr. Miah\u2019s position was that he had not understood the question from the CBSA officer. Mr. Miah argues, and the Respondent concedes, that this was not Mr. Miah\u2019s response. Rather, his explanation to the ID was that his affirmative response to the officer was due to the fact that his name would still be listed in the BNP books as a member. (3) Also during the August 2017 CBSA interview, Mr. Miah made reference to a BNP procession in 2012 and stated: When Tarek Zia [the BNP leader\u2019s son] was arrested, at the time we also\u2026 and also when Tarek Zia was arrested at the time we also performed the procession. And we also performed the procession with the peaceful people of my area. When the ID questioned Mr. Miah about this statement, he stated that he was not present at the procession. The panel found that the contradiction in his testimony greatly affected his credibility. (4) Finally, the ID referred to Mr. Miah\u2019s confirmation of his BNP membership during a December 2014 interview for his U.S. asylum claim. When asked how long he had been a member of the BNP, Mr. Miah responded, \u201cI became a member in 2005, since then\u201d. The ID stated that there was no ambiguity in Mr. Miah\u2019s response and that he had portrayed himself as a BNP member in the context of his U.S. asylum claim, giving no indication that his involvement stopped after 2011. [23] I have considered each of Mr. Miah\u2019s submissions and reviewed the evidence in the record against the ID\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Miah\u2019s attempts to disassociate himself from the BNP from 2011 onwards were not credible. I find that the ID made no reviewable error in its analysis of Mr. Miah\u2019s continued membership in the BNP. The panel addressed Mr. Miah\u2019s evidence and arguments in detail and its conclusion was justified. There was ample evidence before the ID in support of its conclusion that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Mr. Miah\u2019s membership in the BNP continued past the end of 2011. [24] I agree with Mr. Miah that the ID erred in characterizing his explanation of his August 2017 confirmation of membership as a \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d. However, the panel did not err in relying on the statement as contradictory to Mr. Miah\u2019s later submissions that he ceased to be a member at the end of 2011. [25] Mr. Miah argues that his use of the word \u201cwe\u201d in response to questions surrounding the 2012 procession should not be interpreted as indicating he personally participated in the procession and that the word was intended to signify the BNP\u2019s participation more generally. In my view, the fact that an alternate meaning for his answer may exist does not render the ID\u2019s plain reading of the answer unreasonable. 2. Was the ID\u2019s finding that the BNP engaged in acts that fall within the definition of terrorism pursuant to paragraph 34(1)(c) of the IRPA reasonable? [26] Mr. Miah submits that the ID erred in concluding that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the BNP engaged in acts of terrorism within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(c) of the IRPA during the 2012-2014 election period. He argues that the Board did not make a finding that the BNP intended to cause death or serious bodily injury by calling hartals in pursuit of its political goals, as required by the definition of terrorism set out in Suresh and as emphasized in the jurisprudence of this Court. [27] In his submissions, the Respondent canvasses the Court\u2019s jurisprudence and agrees with Mr. Miah that the question in each case is whether the specific intent to cause death or serious injury can be imputed to the BNP. The Respondent relies on the ID\u2019s conclusion that it was not plausible that there was not an underlying intention on the part of the BNP to achieve its goals through violence. The Respondent argues that the documentary evidence in this case was clear and fully supported the panel\u2019s conclusion. [28] As noted above, the ID analysed the evidence in the record regarding the BNP\u2019s involvement in hartals using the Suresh definition. The panel did not rely on the definition of \u201cterrorist activity\u201d in paragraph 83.01(1) of the Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46 (Criminal Code), as was the case in Rana, or on both the Suresh definition and the Criminal Code (see, e.g., Saleheen; Islam v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 912 (Islam)). [29] The SCC\u2019s widely-cited Suresh definition is as follows (Suresh at para 98): [98] In our view, it may safely be concluded, following the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism, that \u201cterrorism\u201d in s. 19 of the Act includes any \u201cact intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any other person not taking an active part in the hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population, or to compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any act\u201d. This definition catches the essence of what the world understands by \u201cterrorism\u201d. \u2026 [30] The SCC did not attempt to establish an exhaustive definition of terrorism, a \u201cnotoriously difficult endeavour\u201d (Suresh at para 93), instead providing a definition that focuses on the intent of the actor or actors in carrying out the specified acts. In this Court, regardless of the definition relied on by the ID or the eventual result in the particular case, each of my colleagues has closely reviewed the decision before them and centred their conclusion on the critical issue of whether the ID reasonably and expressly found that the BNP intended to cause death or serious bodily harm by calling hartals to achieve its political goals. As in each prior case, the outcome of this application turns on the particular facts and documentary evidence in the record and the reasons given by the ID in the Decision (Saleheen at para 26; Rana at para 7; Rahman v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 807 at para 33). [31] In Rana, the ID member applied the Criminal Code definition of \u201cterrorist activity\u201d to the evidence before her regarding the BNP\u2019s activities. Justice Norris emphasized that the intention to cause death or serious bodily harm by the use of violence is an essential element of that Criminal Code definition and the essence of the Suresh definition of terrorism (Rana at para 66): [66] \u2026 Indeed, [the intention to cause death or serious bodily harm] reflects part of what the Supreme Court of Canada expressed in Suresh as the \u201cessence\u201d of what the world understands by \u201cterrorism.\u201d It was a serious error for the member to fail to consider it. Having decided to rely on the Criminal Code definition of \u201cterrorist activity,\u201d it was incumbent on the member to apply it properly. Absent an express finding that when it called for hartals and blockades the BNP intended to cause death or serious bodily harm by the use of violence, to endanger a person\u2019s life, or to cause a serious risk to the health or safety of the public, the finding that this constitutes terrorist activity and, as such, engagement in terrorism within the meaning of section 34(1)(c) of the IRPA, cannot stand. ... (Emphasis in original.) [32] The Court again considered the BNP\u2019s use of hartals and paragraphs 34(1)(c) and (f) of the IRPA in Islam. There, the ID considered both the Criminal Code and Suresh definitions. Justice Roy stated that it was not necessary to decide whether the Suresh decision should govern the ID\u2019s analysis because the difficulty with the decision under review was the ID\u2019s failure to find the required specific intent on the part of the BNP to cause death or serious bodily harm. The ID reviewed the violence inherent in the BNP\u2019s use of hartals in the 2014 election period and concluded only that \u201cby calling for hartals, the BNP leadership knew or, at best, was wilfully blind to the fact that it would result in deaths and serious injuries\u201d (as cited in Islam at para 18). [33] Justice Roy found that the ID wrongly equated intent, knowledge, wilful blindness and recklessness. The fact that the BNP knew or was wilfully blind that hartals would result in deaths or serious injuries was not sufficient. The ID was required, and failed, to find that the BNP intended to cause harm (Islam at para 26). [34] In Saleheen, Associate Chief Justice Gagn\u00e9 reviewed in detail the Court\u2019s recent judgments regarding the BNP\u2019s involvement in the calling of hartals for political purposes and the issue of whether, in so doing, the BNP engaged or engages in acts of terrorism within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(c) of the IRPA (Saleheen at paras 25-37). The Associate Chief Justice confirmed that the specific intention to cause death or serious injury must exist for a finding of terrorism, whether the decision-maker applies the Criminal Code or the Suresh definition (Saleheen at para 41): [41] I agree that a specific intention to cause death or serious injury is required for a finding of terrorism, whether the Criminal Code or the Suresh definition is used. The question of whether the BNP engaged in terrorism turns on whether the requisite specific intention can be imputed to the BNP in the context of this factual record. [35] The factual findings of the ID in Saleheen were not entirely clear. In some passages, the ID focused on the intent to carry out violence. In others, it appeared to equate knowledge of the likelihood of violence with intent or recklessness (which it mistakenly referred to as wilful blindness) (Saleheen at para 45). Nevertheless, Associate Chief Justice Gagn\u00e9 concluded that the ID made the required finding of specific intent to cause violence, citing a number of excerpts from the decision under review and emphasizing the fact that the BNP leadership knowingly ordered its supporters to participate in hartals where the foreseeable consequence was violence. The ID stated (as cited, with emphasis, in Saleheen at para 46): While the opposition consisted of some 18 parties and the Jamaat party are noted as playing an active role in the protests and violence the panel finds that the continuation of the violence likely was intended by the BNP leadership. Continuing to call for the use of a tactic which leads to widespread fire bombings of civilians, injuries and deaths is clear evidence of the intent to use violence as a means to a political end. The fact that this tactic was employed again in January 2015 and the violence was repeated contributes to the finding that it was a deliberate attempt to use violence to undermine the AL government. [36] The issue before me is whether the ID properly applied the Suresh definition of terrorism to the evidence before it and made the required finding that the BNP intended to cause death or serious injury by calling for hartals before and after the 2014 election order to further its political agenda. [37] I begin with a summary of the ID\u2019s factual findings regarding the nature of the BNP\u2019s involvement and the violence occasioned by its use of hartals in 2012-2014. [38] The ID reviewed the history of the use of hartals in Bangladesh and the specific involvement of the BNP. The panel cited from a United Nations Development Program report that detailed the organizational steps that precede a hartal. The decision to call the hartal is made at a meeting of the AL Presidium Committee or the BNP\u2019s Steering Committee, following which the party initiates three to four days of pre-hartal activities, usually by their student wing. Processions and rallies are staged around university campuses. Members of the armed cadre of the party attend to instil an element of fear and apprehension. When the hartal begins, the students rally at pre-planned areas and proceed to police barricades to incite and antagonize police. Bombs are hurled toward the barricades and mayhem ensues. Party workers carry out similar assignments elsewhere in the city, setting off bombs, burning tires and ransacking rickshaws and cars. [39] The ID summarized the BNP\u2019s use of hartals and the rising levels of violence they engendered in the 2012-2014 period: [72] The violence illustrated by the above referred documents, takes the form of killing people who refuse to honour the blockades, attacking democratic institutions, such as polling stations and election officials and throwing petrol bombs at buses and vehicles. When children and innocent bystanders are the victims of indiscriminate violence, we can conclude that actions taken by the perpetrators amount to terrorism. The violent acts perpetrated by BNP members and supporters were for political purposes and aimed at disrupting civilian life. Hartals were frequently called by the BNP to put pressure on the AL government to hold elections under a caretaker government. The hartals have had a profound impact on the economy of Bangladesh (Document C-14) and resulted in numerous violations of human rights. [40] The ID emphasized the involvement of the BNP leadership and found that \u201cthere is a clear and documented pattern\u201d that hartals lead to violence and economic chaos, deaths, random bombings, economic shutdowns and serious injuries. In the ID\u2019s view, the perpetrators of those acts, BNP members and supporters, were engaged in terrorism. [41] The ID\u2019s reliance on the BNP\u2019s involvement in the calling and organizing of a hartal is important as it addresses certain of the indicia noted by this Court in MN v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 796 at paragraph 12, including the circumstances in which the violent acts resulting in death or serious bodily harm were committed, the internal structure of the organization, and the BNP leadership\u2019s knowledge of the violent acts. [42] The ID\u2019s conclusion is set out in two paragraphs: [75] In the present case, the tribunal concludes that violence was used to achieve political objectives, the link between the calls for hartals and the perpetration of terrorist acts is established. Given the predictable consequences of calling a hartal, it is difficult to find that political leaders did not know that deaths amongst the civilian population or serious bodily harm would result. \u2026 Because of the history of decades of violence associated with such political demonstrations only willful blindness would explain that political leaders were not aware of the human rights violations associated with such actions. [76] As illustrated by the documentary evidence, the 2012-2014 period in Bangladesh was one of the most violent in the history of Bangladesh. During that period, the BNP was the organization calling the hartals and promoting social disturbance to achieve political objectives. It is not plausible that there was not an underlying intention to achieve these goals through violence. The consequences of calling a hartal as well as the use of such a method to achieve political goals leaves little doubt of the intentions of political leaders calling for such actions. (My emphasis.) [43] As in Saleheen, the ID\u2019s conclusions in this case imported into the Decision the concepts of knowledge and wilful blindness. However, the ID also found that it was not plausible that the BNP did not intend to further its political goals through the use of violence that would cause civilian deaths and serious injury. The panel traced the history and inevitability of hartal violence; the BNP\u2019s repeated calls for hartals; the role of its leadership, student wings, armed cadre and supporters; the mechanics and perpetrators of the violence; and the resulting deaths and injuries. Although expressed in the negative, the ID imputed to the BNP and its political leaders the requisite specific intention to cause death and bodily harm. In so doing, the panel properly applied the Suresh test. The ID\u2019s finding is internally coherent and justified on the record. [44] The ID then concluded that there were reasonable grounds to believe that the BNP engaged in terrorism during the 2012-2014 period within the meaning of paragraph 34(1)(c) of the IRPA. Reasonable grounds to believe require \u201csomething more than mere suspicion, but less than the standard applicable in civil matters of proof on the balance of probabilities\u201d (Mugesera v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 40 at para 114). I find that the ID\u2019s conclusion is justifiable as its falls within the possible and acceptable outcomes for Mr. Miah\u2019s case. There is no basis for the Court to intervene and set aside the Decision. VIII. Conclusion [45] The application is dismissed. [46] No question for certification was proposed by the parties and none arises in this case.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200106 Docket: IMM-5580-18 Citation: 2020 FC 15 Ottawa, Ontario, January 6, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice James W. O'Reilly BETWEEN: WENNIE ANONUEVO Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] Mr Wennie Anonuevo arrived in Canada on a work permit in 2006, leaving his spouse and six children in the Philippines. Over the ensuing years, Mr Anonuevo worked at a restaurant, even beyond the expiry of his permit. His requests for an extension were denied, and he was asked to leave Canada in 2014. He did not. Instead, he sought a spousal sponsorship based on a common-law relationship in Canada. Ultimately, Mr Anonuevo left Canada in 2015. [2] Back in the Philippines, Mr Anonuevo applied for another work permit. An officer at the Canadian Embassy in the Philippines denied his application, being unpersuaded that Mr Anonuevo would leave Canada at the end of his term, considering the strength of his family ties in Canada and his previous overstaying of his visa. [3] Mr Anonuevo asks me to quash the officer\u2019s decision because it was unreasonable, in particular, by discounting his ties to the Philippines and disregarding his explanation for overstaying his previous work visa. He also maintains that the officer should have advised him of concerns about his prior visa history and allowed him an opportunity to respond. [4] I can find no basis for overturning the officer\u2019s decision. The officer\u2019s conclusion was based on the evidence about Mr Anonuevo\u2019s immigration history. In addition, the officer was not obliged to give Mr Anonuevo a chance to respond to the officer\u2019s concerns. The burden lay on Mr Anonuevo to persuade the officer that his application should be granted. The evidence was simply insufficient. [5] There are two issues: Was the officer\u2019s decision unreasonable? Was the officer obliged to afford Mr Anonuevo a chance to respond to concerns about his application? II. Issue One \u2013 Was the officer\u2019s decision unreasonable? [6] Mr Anonuevo argues that the officer\u2019s decision was unreasonable because it did not take account of his strong family ties to the Philippines. Further, Mr Anonuevo submits that the officer failed to appreciate that he had worked legally in Canada from 2006 to 2014. He overstayed his visa, he says, because his employer assured him that an extension of his work permit was being considered. [7] I disagree. The officer considered Mr Anonuevo\u2019s ties both to Canada and to the Philippines. Mr Anonuevo had spent many years in Canada, away from his family in the Philippines, and had acquired a new family here. The officer reasonably considered the evidence of Mr Anonuevo\u2019s ties to both countries. [8] Further, the officer considered the circumstances surrounding Mr Anonuevo\u2019s past work visa and found that he had not explained his failure to leave Canada once his visa had expired. Mr Anonuevo suggested that his employer had failed to file the necessary documents in time, but the officer found that to be an insufficient explanation. I see nothing unreasonable about the officer\u2019s decision on that issue. III. Issue Two \u2013 Was the officer obliged to afford Mr Anonuevo a chance to respond to concerns about his application? [9] Mr Anonuevo argues that the officer had an obligation to inform him of any concerns about his application, especially in light of his good immigration record in Canada. [10] I disagree. The officer considered Mr Anonuevo\u2019s explanation and found it to be inadequate. In addition, any refusal of a work permit for Mr Anonuevo would not prevent him from re-applying. In the circumstances, the officer was not obliged to give Mr Anonuevo an opportunity to respond to his concerns. IV. Conclusion and Disposition [11] The officer\u2019s decision was not unreasonable. Nor did the officer treat Mr Anonuevo unfairly by not affording him an opportunity to respond to concerns arising from his application. I must, therefore, dismiss this application for judicial review. Neither party proposed a question of general importance for me to certify, and none is stated. JUDGMENT IN IMM-5580-18 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that the application for judicial review is dismissed, and no question is certified. \"James W.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200122 Docket: IMM-1265-19 Citation: 2020 FC 95 Ottawa, Ontario, January 22, 2020 PRESENT: Mr. Justice Russell BETWEEN: GURDEEP SINGH SANGHA Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. INTRODUCTION [1] This is an application under s 72 (1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA], for judicial review of the decision of a Visa Officer, dated January 24, 2019 [Decision], denying the Applicant\u2019s work permit application. II. BACKGROUND [2] The Applicant, Gurdeep Singh Sangha, is a citizen of India. He is currently on a work permit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates [UAE] where he is working as a truck driver. The Applicant now seeks a work permit to work as a long-haul truck driver for Rig Logistics Inc. [Rig] in Rocky View, Alberta. [3] On August 20, 2018, Rig received a Labour Market Impact Assessment [LMIA] from Employment and Social Development Canada/Service Canada, which concluded that the hiring of fifteen foreign nationals to work as long-haul truck drivers out of Rocky View, Alberta would have a \u201cpositive or neutral impact on the Canadian labour market.\u201d The LMIA therefore invited the foreign nationals in question to submit their work permit applications to Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada [IRCC]. The LMIA noted that the job requirements included secondary school education as well as verbal and written English language skills. [4] On November 5, 2018, the Applicant signed a 24-month employment contract with Rig. The contract stipulates that the Applicant agrees to carry out the following tasks: \u25cf Load and unload goods; \u25cf Tarping and ensuring safety and security of cargo; \u25cf Perform emergency roadside repairs; \u25cf Operate and drive straight or articulated trucks to transport goods and materials; \u25cf Record cargo information, hours of service, distance travelled and fuel consumption; \u25cf Perform pre-trip, en route and post-trip inspection and oversee all aspects of vehicle; \u25cf Oversee condition of vehicle and inspect tires, lights, brakes, cold storage and other equipment; [and] \u25cf Receive and relay information to central dispatch, drive as part of a two-person team or convoy. [5] A few days after signing the employment contract, the Applicant submitted his application for a work permit to IRCC. In his application, the Applicant notes that: he is able to communicate in English; holds a secondary school degree; and has held a heavy vehicle licence in Dubai since May 2017. He also lists his relevant work experience. Indeed, his application indicates that he worked as a truck driver in Dubai since March 2016 and worked as a school bus driver in Faridkot, Punjab from February 2010 to November 2015. The Applicant provided letters from both employers confirming his work experience along with his current salary as a truck driver in Dubai. III. DECISION UNDER REVIEW [6] On January 24, 2019, the Applicant received a letter from the Visa Officer denying his application for a work permit. The Visa Officer indicated that his application did not meet the requirements of the IRPA. More specifically, the Visa Officer concluded that the Applicant was \u201cnot able to demonstrate that [he would] be able to adequately perform the work,\u201d in question. [7] The Visa Officer\u2019s notes provide more in-depth reasons for denying the work permit application. The Visa Officer first acknowledged in his notes that: (1) the Applicant holds a heavy vehicle licence; (2) has two and a half years of work experience as a truck driver in UAE; and (3) has secondary school education. However, the Visa Officer also raises several concerns, notably that the Applicant did not provide: International English Language Testing System [IELTS] test results; Bank statements confirming the salary paid to him as a truck driver in the UAE; and Evidence of formal truck driver training. [8] As such, the Visa Officer concluded that the Applicant did not establish that he \u201chas the necessary skills to adequately perform the proposed work in Canada in a manner that protects the safety of Canadians.\u201d The work permit application was therefore refused. IV. ISSUES [9] The issues to be determined in the present matter are the following: Did the Visa Officer\u2019s Decision violate the Applicant\u2019s right to procedural fairness? Did the Visa Officer erroneously assess the Applicant\u2019s language abilities? Did the Visa Officer erroneously heighten the employment requirements when analyzing the Applicant\u2019s ability to perform the proposed work? V. STANDARD OF REVIEW [10] This application was argued prior to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s recent decisions in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] and Bell Canada v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66. This Court\u2019s judgment was taken under reserve. The parties\u2019 submissions on the standard of review were therefore made under the Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir] framework. However, given the circumstances in this matter, and the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s instructions in Vavilov at para 144, this Court found that it was not necessary to ask the parties to make additional submissions on the standard of review. I have applied the Vavilov framework in my consideration of the application and it does not change the applicable standards of review in this case nor my conclusions. [11] In Vavilov, at paras 23-32, the majority sought to simplify how a court selects the standard of review applicable to the issues before it. The majority did away with the contextual and categorical approach taken in Dunsmuir in favour of instating a presumption that the reasonableness standard applies. However, the majority noted that this presumption can be set aside on the basis of (1) clear legislative intent to prescribe a different standard of review (Vavilov, at paras 33-52), and (2) certain scenarios where the rule of law requires the application of the standard of correctness, such as constitutional questions, general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole and questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies (Vavilov, at paras 53-64). [12] Both the Applicant and the Respondent submitted that the standard of review applicable to the issue of procedural fairness was that of correctness while the standard of review applicable to the Visa Officer\u2019s assessment of the Applicant\u2019s work permit application was that of reasonableness. [13] Some courts have held that the standard of review for an allegation of procedural unfairness is \u201ccorrectness\u201d (Mission Institution v Khela, 2014 SCC 24 at para 79; Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Khosa, 2009 SCC 12 at paras 59 and 61 [Khosa]). The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Vavilov does not address the standard of review applicable to issues of procedural fairness (Vavilov, at para 23). However, a more doctrinally sound approach is that no standard of review at all is applicable to the question of procedural fairness. The Supreme Court of Canada in Moreau-B\u00e9rub\u00e9 v New Brunswick (Judicial Council), 2002 SCC 11 stated that the issue of procedural fairness: requires no assessment of the appropriate standard of judicial review. Evaluating whether procedural fairness, or the duty of fairness, has been adhered to by a tribunal requires an assessment of the procedures and safeguards required in a particular situation (Moreau-B\u00e9rub\u00e9, para 74). [14] As for the standard of review applicable to the Visa Officer\u2019s assessment of the work permit application, there is nothing to rebut the presumption that the standard of reasonableness applies in this case. The application of the standard of reasonableness to this issue is also consistent with the existing jurisprudence prior to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Vavilov. Indeed, prior to Vavilov it was well established that the standard of reasonableness applies. See Toor v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1143 at para 6, Baran v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 463 at paras 15-16, and Bui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 440 at paras 22-23. [15] When reviewing a decision on the standard of reasonableness, the analysis will be concerned with whether it \u201cbears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov, at para 99). Reasonableness is a single standard of review that varies and \u201ctakes its colour from the context\u201d (Vavilov, at para 89 citing Khosa, at para 59). These contextual constraints \u201cdictate the limits and contours of the space in which the decision maker may act and the types of solutions it may adopt\u201d (Vavilov, at para 90). Put in another way, the Court should intervene only when \u201cthere are sufficiently serious shortcomings in the decision such that it cannot be said to exhibit the requisite degree of justification, intelligibility and transparency\u201d (Vavilov, at para 100). The Supreme Court of Canada lists two types of fundamental flaws that make a decision unreasonable: (1) a failure of rationality internal to the decision-maker\u2019s reasoning process; and (2) untenability \u201cin light of the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it\u201d (Vavilov, at para 101). VI. STATUTORY PROVISIONS [16] The following statutory provisions of the IRPA are relevant to this application for judicial review: Application before entering Canada Visa et documents 11 (1) A foreign national must, before entering Canada, apply to an officer for a visa or for any other document required by the regulations. The visa or document may be issued if, following an examination, the officer is satisfied that the foreign national is not inadmissible and meets the requirements of this Act. 11 (1) L\u2019\u00e9tranger doit, pr\u00e9alablement \u00e0 son entr\u00e9e au Canada, demander \u00e0 l\u2019agent les visa et autres documents requis par r\u00e8glement. L\u2019agent peut les d\u00e9livrer sur preuve, \u00e0 la suite d\u2019un contr\u00f4le, que l\u2019\u00e9tranger n\u2019est pas interdit de territoire et se conforme \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sente loi. \u2026 \u2026 Regulations R\u00e8glements 32 The regulations may provide for any matter relating to the application of sections 27 to 31, may define, for the purposes of this Act, the terms used in those sections, and may include provisions respecting 32 Les r\u00e8glements r\u00e9gissent l\u2019application des articles 27 \u00e0 31, d\u00e9finissent, pour l\u2019application de la pr\u00e9sente loi, les termes qui y sont employ\u00e9s et portent notamment sur : (a) classes of temporary residents, such as students and workers; a) les cat\u00e9gories de r\u00e9sidents temporaires, notamment les \u00e9tudiants et les travailleurs ; \u2026 \u2026 [17] The following provision of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227 [Regulations] is relevant to this application for judicial review: 200 (3) An officer shall not issue a work permit to a foreign national if 200 (3) Le permis de travail ne peut \u00eatre d\u00e9livr\u00e9 \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9tranger dans les cas suivants : (a) there are reasonable grounds to believe that the foreign national is unable to perform the work sought; a) l\u2019agent a des motifs raisonnables de croire que l\u2019\u00e9tranger est incapable d\u2019exercer l\u2019emploi pour lequel le permis de travail est demand\u00e9 ; \u2026 \u2026 VII. ARGUMENTS A. Applicant [18] The Applicant submits that the Visa Officer\u2019s Decision to deny his work permit application breaches his right to procedural fairness and, in any case, was unreasonable. Consequently, he asks that this Court overturn the Decision and return the application to a different visa officer to be re-determined. (1) Breach of Procedural Fairness [19] The Applicant argues that the Visa Officer violated his right to procedural fairness by not allowing him to respond to the veiled credibility finding concerning the contents of his employment letter. He states that the negative inference drawn by the Visa Officer regarding the Applicant\u2019s failure to provide bank statements confirming his salary equates to a credibility finding, as the employment letter provided by the Applicant included a breakdown of his salary. [20] Since the Visa Officer makes no mention of the Applicant\u2019s employment letters or why the bank statements are critical to the assessment of his application, the Applicant argues that the only logical conclusion is that the Visa Officer did not find the information contained in the letters to be credible. The Applicant suggests that the Visa Officer might have believed that the Applicant had never even worked for a trucking company in Dubai. [21] The Applicant submits that this Court has held on numerous occasions that the duty of procedural fairness requires a visa officer to provide an applicant with the opportunity to address concerns relating to the credibility of the information submitted. The Applicant cites Justice Mosley\u2019s decision in Hassani v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 1283: [24] Having reviewed the factual context of the cases cited above, it is clear that where a concern arises directly from the requirements of the legislation or related regulations, a visa officer will not be under a duty to provide an opportunity for the applicant to address his or her concerns. Where, however, the issue is not one that arises in this context, such a duty may arise. This is often the case where the credibility, accuracy or genuine nature of information submitted by the applicant in support of their application is the basis of the visa officer\u2019s concern, as was the case in Rukmangathan, and in John [John v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2003), 2003 FCT 257 26 Imm. L.R. (3d) 221 (F.C.T.D.)] and Cornea [Cornea v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2003), 2003 FCT 257, 30 Imm. L.R. (3D) 38 (F.C.)] cited by the Court in Rukmangathan, above. [Emphasis added]. [22] The Applicant also notes that this was reiterated by Justice Zinn in Madadi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 716 at para 6. [23] Since the Visa Officer did not provide the Applicant with an opportunity to address these credibility concerns, the Applicant concludes that there was a breach of procedural fairness. (2) Assessment of the Applicant\u2019s Language Abilities [24] The Applicant also submits that the Visa Officer unreasonably assessed the issue of the Applicant\u2019s language abilities by failing to analyze how they would affect his capacity to perform the proposed work. [25] The Applicant cites IRCC\u2019s operational manual which states that when: [\u2026] deciding to require proof of language ability, the officer\u2019s notes should refer to the LMIA requirements, working conditions as described in the job offer and NOC requirements for the specific occupation, in determining what precise level of language requirement is necessary to perform the work sought. System notes must clearly indicate the officer\u2019s language assessment, and in the case of a refusal, clearly show a detailed analysis on how the applicant failed to satisfy the officer that they would be able to perform the work sought. [26] Accordingly, the Applicant argues that the LMIA only required oral and written English capabilities and that none of the tasks set out in the employment contract require a high level of English. Moreover, he notes that the Visa Officer failed to consider that Rig has already verified that the Applicant\u2019s language abilities meet those required for the job. Therefore, the Applicant argues that, by requiring IELTS test results, the Visa Officer is unreasonably \u201cimporting an English level not necessary for the position,\u201d which is analogous to this Court\u2019s finding in Tan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1079 at paras 41-42 [Tan] and contrary to IRCC\u2019s operational manual. (3) Heightening of the Employment Requirements [27] Finally, the Applicant submits that it was unreasonable for the Visa Officer to require formal training in truck driving in order to obtain the work permit when the LMIA and the applicable National Occupation Classification [NOC] only require secondary school education. [28] Although the relevant NOC states that an \u201caccredited driver training course of up to three months [\u2026] may be required,\u201d the Applicant argues that the word \u201cmay\u201d clearly indicates that this is not a hard requirement. [29] As such, the Applicant submits that the Visa Officer clearly heightened the employment requirements above those contained in the LMIA and the NOC without justification as to why this was necessary for the Applicant to adequately perform the proposed work in Canada, thus making the Decision unreasonable. Instead, the Applicant suggests his previous truck driving experience and his secondary school education are sufficient in this case. B. Respondent [30] The Respondent submits that the Visa Officer in no way violated the Applicant\u2019s right to procedural fairness and conducted a thorough and reasonable analysis of the work permit application. As such, the Visa Officer\u2019s Decision should be upheld. (1) Breach of Procedural Fairness [31] The Respondent argues that there is no breach of procedural fairness in this case as there was no credibility finding made by the Visa Officer. In fact, the Respondent points to the Visa Officer\u2019s notes, which show that the Applicant\u2019s work experience as a truck driver in the UAE is accepted and believed by the Visa Officer. [32] Instead, the Respondent argues that this is a case where the Applicant simply failed to demonstrate that he satisfied the requirements of the IRPA and the Regulations. The Respondent states that it is well established that it is the applicant who has the burden of satisfying the visa officer that they have met all the legislative requirements to obtain the requested work permit. [33] In fact, the Respondent notes that this Court has held on numerous occasions that, should an applicant fail to provide sufficient proof to satisfy the visa officer that a work permit ought to be granted, the visa officer has no duty to afford the applicant with an opportunity to provide additional information. The Respondent notes that this is stated succinctly in Pacheco Silva v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 733 [Pacheco Silva]: [20] I am of the view that the principles of procedural fairness have not been breached in the circumstances of this case. The onus is on the Applicant to provide all relevant supporting documentation and sufficient credible evidence in support of his application. In her decision letter, the Officer clearly stated that the Applicant had not discharged this onus. It is for the Applicant to put his best case forward. See Lam v. Canada (M.C.I.) (1998) 152 F.T.R. 316 (T.D.). The onus does not shift to the Officer and there is no entitlement to a personal interview if the application is ambiguous or supporting material is not included. Here, there was no obligation on the Officer to gather or seek additional evidence or make further inquiries. (2) Assessment of the Applicant\u2019s Language Abilities [34] The Respondent points out that the burden is on the Applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer that he has met all the legislative requirements to obtain the work permit in question. In this case, the Applicant did not provide any evidence that he had the written and oral English abilities required to adequately perform the work in question, despite the fact that these language requirements were clearly noted in the LMIA. Furthermore, the Respondent notes that the Visa Officer could not have been expected to undertake a detailed analysis of the Applicant\u2019s language skills in relation to the work in question; there was simply no evidence provided for the Visa Officer to analyze. [35] The Respondent claims that the case at bar is distinguishable from Tan, above, because the Visa Officer did not import heightened language requirements in this case but, instead, simply sought to apply the requirements stipulated in the LMIA. The Respondent cites Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 360 at paras 12-13 and Singh Grewal v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 627 at para 17, as both decisions confirm that an applicant has the burden of establishing that they met the language requirement. [36] Moreover, the Respondent notes that the Visa Officer is under a duty to examine the evidence at hand to assess whether an applicant is able to adequately perform the work in question. Though the Applicant argues that Rig was of the opinion that he fulfilled the language requirements for the job, this Court has recognized in Chen v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 1378 at para 12 that a visa officer is not bound by the statements of an employer concerning language requirements or the sufficiency of an applicant\u2019s language abilities. (3) Heightening of the Employment Requirements [37] Finally, the Respondent argues that the work requirements in the LMIA are not determinative of how a visa officer should exercise their discretion when assessing a work permit application. The Respondent cites Sluice v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1132 where this Court confirmed that the visa officer has a duty to conduct an independent assessment of the applicant\u2019s ability to perform the work sought. [38] The Respondent also cites Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 115 [Singh (2015)] where this Court considered a similar case. In Singh (2015), the applicant had 10 years of truck driving experience in Italy, a letter of employment, and proof of a valid licence. Nevertheless, despite meeting the requirements set out in the Labour Market Opinion, the applicant\u2019s work permit was rejected because the visa officer was not satisfied that the applicant could adequately perform the work in question. The Respondent highlights that this Court recognized in that case that the requirements in the Labour Market Opinion were not binding on the visa officer\u2019s independent assessment of whether an applicant can adequately perform the work in question (Singh 2015, above, at para 20). VIII. ANALYSIS [39] As the Decision makes clear, the Applicant\u2019s work permit application was refused because he was not able to demonstrate that he would be able to perform the work he was seeking in Canada. [40] Subsection 200(3) of the Regulations stipulates that an officer shall not issue a work permit to a foreign national if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the foreign national is unable to perform the work sought. [41] The Visa Officer\u2019s notes show that he was \u201cnot satisfied that [the Applicant] ha[d] the necessary skills to adequately perform the proposed work in Canada in a manner that protects the safety of Canadians.\u201d [42] The Applicant does not argue that the Visa Officer committed a reviewable error by considering the safety of Canadians. Subsection 200(3) of the Regulations does not stipulate a level of competence or safety, but in the case of a long-haul truck driver, safety must surely be a paramount requirement for competence. In this regard, the jurisprudence is clear: the onus is upon the applicant for a work permit to provide sufficient evidence to establish competence; that a visa officer has a wide discretion to decide this issue and; that their decision is entitled to a high degree of deference. See, for example, Taipur v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 25 at paras 19-20 and Khosa, above, at paras 4 and 46. [43] The Visa Officer specifically notes and references the experience and qualifications the Applicant did submit. However, the clear message is that what was submitted was not sufficient to satisfy the Visa Officer that the Applicant would be able to perform the job in a manner, and to a level, that would protect the safety of Canadians. [44] In the end, of course, the Visa Officer must be satisfied in this matter and not the Court, provided his assessment is reasonable and is grounded in the evidence submitted. It is quite common in work permit judicial review applications for applicants to disagree with a visa officer and say that, in their opinion, they did satisfy the requirements. Nonetheless, such disagreement is not a ground of judicial review. [45] In the present case, for instance, the Applicant argues that: a) The Visa Officer imports into the Decision a higher level of English language ability than the job requires and \u201chas failed to tie the language analysis with the relevant policy guidelines, the NOC duties, and the employment contract\u201d; b) The Visa Officer imports a non-existent employment requirement by requiring evidence of formal training in truck driving; and c) The Visa Officer breached his right to procedural fairness by requiring copies of bank statements demonstrating his salary instead of relying on the letters from his employer that confirm his employment and his salary (this issue was withdrawn at the hearing). [46] The Visa Officer notes the contents of the application and makes it clear that the principal concerns are: Whether the Applicant had the necessary skills to be a long-haul truck driver in Canada. In this regard, the Visa Officer noted that the \u201c[Applicant] did not provide evidence that he has received formal training in truck driving. Noted [the Applicant] has work [sic] for past 2.5 years as a truck driver in UAE\u201d; Whether the Applicant has the necessary linguistic skills for the job. In this regard, the Visa Officer noted that the \u201c[Applicant] did not provide IELTS.\u201d [47] The Visa Officer also noted that the Applicant \u201cdid not provide bank statements demonstrating salary paid for truck driving position in UAE.\u201d In written submissions, the Applicant argued that this raised a procedural fairness issue because it demonstrated that the Visa Officer was questioning the veracity of what he and others had said about his job in the UAE. However, at the oral hearing of the present application before this Court, the Applicant withdrew this ground of review. In my view, that was appropriate because the Visa Officer was entitled to look for objective confirmation of what the Applicant had said about his job in the UAE, and the reference to bank statements is nothing more than a suggestion as to how this could be done. This issue was one of adequate documentation, not credibility, and did not require the Visa Officer to give the Applicant a further opportunity to address this issue. The onus is upon an applicant to put their best case forward in their application. The Visa Officer is not required to assist in this process by contacting an applicant and advising them on any deficiencies (Pacheco Silva, above, at para 20). [48] I am also of the view that, regarding driving skills, the Visa Officer does not make \u201cformal training\u201d into a requirement for a work permit. Read as a whole, the Visa Officer\u2019s approach is to itemize what does appear in the application and some things that are missing. He refers to the Applicant\u2019s actual experience of two and a half years but is clearly concerned about the adequacy of this experience in a Canadian context, in light of the fact that the Applicant has had no \u201cformal training.\u201d This does not mean the Visa Officer is making formal training a requirement. The Visa Officer\u2019s overall concern is that he is \u201cnot satisfied that the Applicant has the necessary skills to adequately perform the proposed work in Canada in a manner that protects the safety of Canadians.\u201d The Applicant may disagree, and obviously feels that his two and a half years of driving in the UAE is sufficient, but the Visa Officer believes otherwise and I do not think the Court is in a position to substitute its opinion for that of the Visa Officer on this issue, given his broad discretion (Vavilov, above, at para 83; Khosa, above, at paras 59-61). [49] Regarding language skills, the Applicant acknowledged through counsel at the hearing of his application that he had not submitted sufficient evidence that he had the necessary language capability in English for the job. However, he maintained that the Visa Officer was, once again, imposing a formal requirement (i.e. an IELTS) that the job did not require. [50] However, when the Decision is read as a whole and the Visa Officer\u2019s general conclusion is taken into account about the skills necessary to perform the work \u201cin a manner that protects the safety of Canadians,\u201d I do not think that the Visa Officer is saying any more than the Applicant had not demonstrated sufficient language capability for the job (which the Applicant does not take issue with) and that one of the ways this could be done is through an IELTS. [51] So, in the end, the work permit was refused because the Applicant failed to convince the Visa Officer that he had the necessary experience or the required language abilities for the job. It is possible to disagree with this conclusion, but I cannot say that it was reached as a result of a reviewable error. [52] Both parties agree there is no question for certification and the Court concurs. JUDGMENT IN IMM-1265-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that The application is dismissed.

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200122 Docket: IMM-2852-19 Citation: 2020 FC 92 Ottawa, Ontario, January 22, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Pamel BETWEEN: YUNUS GOKKOCA Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Nature of the case [1] In this case, the Applicant submits that the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] adopted six different standards of proof in assessing the Applicant\u2019s refugee claim: \u201cwhat is likely to happen,\u201d \u201cwill face persecution,\u201d \u201cis likely to suffer persecution,\u201d \u201cwould be persecuted,\u201d \u201cconvince,\u201d and \u201cmore than a mere possibility.\u201d To the Applicant, the RAD\u2019s adoption of varying, and sometimes incorrect statements of the applicable legal tests constitutes a grave legal error; hence, this judicial review proceeding. [2] However, the Applicant\u2019s arguments consist of objections to certain turns of phrases that merely elaborate upon the RAD\u2019s findings under the rubric of the appropriate legal tests. [3] For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the application. II. Facts [4] The Applicant is a citizen of Turkey . He is of Kurdish ethnicity and adheres to Alevism. He is also a member of the Republican People\u2019s Party [Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi or CHP]. Since 2002, the CHP has been the main opposition political party in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The CHP is the oldest political party in Turkey . [5] The Applicant claims that his Turkish teachers humiliated and discriminated against him, and that he is at risk of persecution in Turkey due to his support for the CHP, his Kurdish ethnicity, and his Alevi faith. [6] In May and June 2013, the Applicant participated in demonstrations. At one of these demonstrations, the Applicant was detained, beaten, and then released the following day. He was also photographed and questioned about various incidents. In 2015, the Applicant became CHP\u2019s vice president in his town. He also took part in a demonstration in October 2015 at which he was beaten and released the following day. [7] In March 2016, the Applicant was detained during a demonstration. The Applicant was taken to the Security Headquarters by a police officer, where he was searched, beaten, and questioned about illegal organizations. The Applicant was released after 36 hours of detention. [8] Following the July 2016 Turkish coup d\u2019\u00e9tat attempt, the Applicant was regularly stopped and searched, and threatened with detention. [9] During the 2017 Turkish constitutional referendum, the Applicant worked for the \u201cNo\u201d campaign. While campaigning, he was confronted by the same police officer who had harassed him in March 2016, and taken to the Anti-Terror branch where he was strip searched, forced to sign a Body Search Report, humiliated, fingerprinted, questioned, threatened with detention, beaten, and released after 36 hours. In April 2017, he was threatened by the police chief of his town who said that the next time he would not be released. The \u201cYes\u201d side eventually won the referendum, and Turkey has since adopted an executive presidency model of government. [10] The Applicant was threatened again by the same police chief after participating in a demonstration held after the results of the constitutional referendum. [11] In July 2017, the Applicant received a study permit to Canada . The Applicant arrived to Canada on July 19, 2017. The Applicant was informed by his father that the police chief came to their home asking about his whereabouts after he came to Canada , and that the same police chief (who threatened to kill him in April 2017) came to the family home seeking the Applicant in the first week of August 2017 and in mid-September 2018. [12] The Refugee Protection Division [RPD] dismissed the Applicant\u2019s refugee claim in December 2017. In essence, the RPD concluded that the Applicant was not a Convention refugee nor a person in need of protection because he had failed to establish that he would face more than a mere possibility of persecution in Turkey. [13] During the hearing, the Applicant\u2019s counsel conceded that there was no documentary evidence of CHP supporters being targeted or mistreated in Turkey . The RPD found that the Applicant\u2019s claims of mistreatment by Turkish authorities were contradicted by the absence of any evidence of mistreatment against CHP supporters. The RPD also considered the Applicant\u2019s residual profile (half-Kurdish, Alevi in religion, and a member of the CHP). [14] The Applicant appealed the RPD\u2019s decision to the RAD. On appeal, the Applicant argued that the RPD failed to conduct a cumulative, mixed-motives analysis of his risk profile as a Kurd, Alevi and member of the CHP. The Applicant did not challenge the RPD\u2019s finding regarding the implausibility of his mistreatment by Turkish authorities. III. Decision under review [15] On April 10, 2019, the RAD confirmed the RPD\u2019s decision. The central issue was the Applicant\u2019s risk profile as an Alevi, as a person of Kurdish descent, and as a partisan of the CHP. The RAD dismissed the Applicant\u2019s section 96 claim. The RAD did not find any evidence to suggest that support for the CHP would cause any problems for the Applicant. The RAD found that the Applicant\u2019s profile did not constitute a cumulative factor of risk in Turkey . The RAD did not agree with the Applicant that the RPD failed to consider the mixed-motives aspect of the claim. The RAD concluded that the Applicant did not require protection under section 97 in his hometown ( Mersin ) or in other parts of Turkey unaffected by the civil war conditions. IV. Issues [16] This case raises the following issue: Did the RAD adopt the appropriate standard of proof for its analysis of the Applicant\u2019s refugee claim? [17] While the arguments on judicial review are different, the following cases present a similar fact pattern to the one at bar: Kuzu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 917; Kusmez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 948; Aydin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1329). V. Standard of review [18] The parties are in agreement that the RAD decision attracts the reasonableness standard of review, correctly in my view (Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para 23 [Vavilov]). [19] To determine whether the decision was reasonable, this Court must ask whether the RAD\u2019s decision \u201cbears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2013 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2013 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov at para 99). [20] Reasonableness review should not be viewed as a \u201cline-by-line treasure hunt for error\u201d (Vavilov at para 102 citing Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, Local 30 v Irving Pulp & Paper, Ltd, 2013 SCC 34 at para 54). VI. Discussion [21] The Applicant submits that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Vavilov does not constitute a departure from precedent (Adjei v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), 1989 CanLII 5184 (FCA), [1989] 2 FC 680 [Adjei] and Alam v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 4 [Alam]) in relation to the proper test to be applied as regards the risk of persecution. I agree. I do not read Vavilov as a repudiation of the well-settled test for risk under section 96 of the IRPA, that is whether there is a reasonable chance, or more than a mere possibility, of facing persecution. [22] The Applicant submits, however, that the RAD adopted six standards of proof in assessing the Applicant\u2019s section 96 claim, and, citing Alam and Adjei, argues that the lack of clarity on the RAD\u2019s choice of standard of proof constitutes a reviewable error. [23] In Adjei, the Immigration Appeal Board [the Board] dismissed an application for refugee protection on the ground that the applicant had not demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution. In coming to its decision, the Board stated \u201c[t]he test is whether there is a reasonable chance, or are substantial grounds for thinking that the persecution may take place\u201d [emphasis added] (Adjei at para 3). [24] The Federal Court of Appeal allowed the application for judicial review on the ground that the Board relied on the test of \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d as equivalent to the test of \u201creasonable chance\u201d in the determination of whether the applicant was likely to suffer persecution if he was to return to his native Ghana . According to the Federal Court of Appeal, by equating \u201csubstantial grounds\u201d with \u201creasonable chance\u201d, the Board introduced an element of ambiguity into the formulation of the test itself. [25] That is not, however, what has happened in this case. I agree with the Respondent that the Applicant\u2019s objections result from a distortion of the significance of the RAD decision. He failed to appreciate the distinction between the formulation of a legal test, and the rephrasing of the components of a thought process. [26] On a full reading of the RAD decision, in particular the conclusion, unlike the situation in Adjei, the RAD did not rely on an erroneous or confusing test, but on the proper test to be applied under the circumstances. The Board did not impose a more onerous burden of proof upon the Applicant than the law requires (Alam). It seems clear to me that the RAD assessed the evidence against the correct legal standard (Sivagnanasundarampillai v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1109 at para 14 [Sivagnanasundarampillai]; Talipoglu v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 172 at paras 27-28). [27] The Applicant\u2019s submissions concentrate on five turns of phrase. I highlight each one below. (1) \u201cWhat is likely to happen\u201d [28] The Applicant argues that the RAD adopted an inappropriate standard of proof at paragraph 16 of its decision. Paragraph 16 reads as follows: However, refugee protection must be forward looking, that is, what is likely to happen if the Appellant is returned to his country of nationality. Regardless of what has or has not occurred in the past, does this Appellant face more than a mere possibility of persecution upon his return to Turkey . [Emphasis added.] [29] The Applicant argues that a plain reading of the words \u201cwhat is likely to happen\u201d shows that the RAD adopted a higher standard of proof, and that although the RAD did identify the proper test, when it tried to explain what it meant, it still erred. [30] I agree with the Applicant that the use of the words \u201clikely to suffer\u201d is confusing. Normally, the use of the word \u201clikely\u201d denotes a test more in line with the \u201cbalance of probabilities\u201d or \u201cmore likely than not\u201d. This is not the test for the assessment of risk in relation to persecution. [31] However, I do not read paragraph 16 in the same way as the Applicant. The reference to \u201cwhat is likely to happen\u201d is not meant as a recital of the test for persecution, but rather a reference to the fact that the process itself is \u201cforward looking.\u201d As regards the assessment of risk, the RAD did articulate the proper test: \u201cdoes this Appellant face more than a mere possibility of persecution.\u201d [32] I see no confusion here. (2) \u201cWill face persecution\u201d and \u201creal risk of persecution\u201d [33] At paragraphs 25 and 26 of the RAD reasons, the Applicant argues that the RAD gave itself the task of determining whether the Applicant \u201cwill face persecution\u201d in Turkey. Paragraphs 25 and 26 read as follows: 25. It is not the role of the RAD to decide on the righteousness of one cause over another which is what I would be doing were I to side with Kurdish militants or the Turkish forces on this struggle. My job is to determine whether the Appellant will face persecution upon his return to Turkey . 26. The document cited above, in conjunction with others, strongly indicates that the Appellant will not be exposed to a real risk of persecution in Turkey [\u2026] [Emphasis added.] [34] As regards paragraph 25, the Applicant argues that it is not for the RAD to determine whether the Applicant will face persecution. However, upon reading the whole paragraph, it is clear to me that the RAD is not elucidating a legal test. Rather, the RAD is simply clarifying that it will not pick sides in the conflict between the Kurdish separatists and the current Turkish government. [35] As regards paragraph 26, the use of the phrase \u201creal risk of persecution\u201d is, again, not meant to articulate or explain the test to be applied in the assessment of persecution, but rather is used to explain the extent to which the documents referred to support the Applicant\u2019s argument of an exposure to such persecution. [36] Again, I see nothing here to suggest that the RAD conflated two different tests in the assessment of the risk of persecution. (3) Section 96 vs Section 97 test [37] The Applicant argues that, at paragraph 29, the RAD applied a lower test to the Applicant\u2019s section 97 claim and a higher test (balance of probabilities) to his section 96 claim. Paragraph 29 reads as follows: In this appeal, however, Counsel has referenced many paragraphs and pages from various documents on the record (the NDP and news articles). Most of these documents are speaking to what has become to be called a \u201chuman rights disaster\u201d in Turkey . In most cases, the issues are dealing not with law-abiding Kurds but with Kurdish militants who have waged what amounts to a civil war against the Turkish government. As previously stated, it is not for me to decide which side of the con\ufb02ict is right or wrong. What I can decide is whether a Kurd who is not involved with the militancy in south-east Turkey is likely to suffer persecution. Is there more than a mere possibility that Kurds, in general and this Kurdish Appellant, will suffer a risk to their lives, or a risk to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, or a risk of torture? [Emphasis added.] [38] Again, the use of the word \u201clikely\u201d may open the door to interpretation. However, I do not believe that anything turns on this word in this paragraph, standing alone, nor that it is determinative. [39] Reading the RAD decision as a whole, it seems clear to me that the RAD did have the proper test in mind. I say this, in particular, because of the proper enunciation of the test elsewhere in its decision, in particular, in the conclusion. I am also mindful of the finding of the RAD, at paragraph 26, after having reviewed the documents cited by the Applicant, where it stated: Should the Appellant return to Turkey and live in Mersin , where his family resides, he should experience no persecution. [40] The RAD found that there was no discernable evidence of persecution towards the Applicant, regardless how paragraph 29 is to be interpreted. [41] In the context of paragraph 29, it seems to me that the RAD is, again, careful not to take sides in the ongoing political conflict in Turkey , and is focusing on what the Applicant may face upon his return. I do not see here a restatement of the applicable test. (4) \u201cWould be persecuted\u201d [42] The Applicant submits that, at paragraph 32, the RAD adopted an erroneous standard of proof when it found that there was insufficient evidence to suggest that the Applicant \u201cwould be persecuted\u201d in Turkey. [43] Paragraph 32 reads as follows: In regard to possible section 97(1) appeal, it would appear from the documents on the record that the south-east zone of Turkey would present a substantial risk to the Appellant, as it does to all of the people living in what is a virtual war zone, between the government troops and the Kurdish militants. However, the Appellant does not live, nor did he live, in that area. He is from Mersin in the south-west of Turkey . The Appellant has shown insuf\ufb01cient evidence to support his allegations that he would be persecuted in Mersin , or in three-quarters of Turkey , due to his ethno-religious CHP involvement. [Emphasis added.] [44] If one reads the paragraph in its entirety, it is clear that the RAD was simply reiterating the Applicant\u2019s allegation on appeal, namely, his allegation \u201cthat he would be persecuted in Mersin, or in three-quarters of Turkey, due to his ethno-religious CHP involvement.\u201d The RAD\u2019s summary of the Applicant\u2019s allegation on appeal should not be confused with a statement of a legal test. (5) \u201cConvince\u201d [45] The Applicant takes issue with the RAD\u2019s use of the word \u201cconvince\u201d (at paragraph 33) within the section 96 claim, arguing that it connotes a stricter assessment of the risk threshold (citing Chichmanov v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] FCJ No 832 (FCA), Mirzabeglui v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1991] FCJ No 50 (FCA)). To the Applicant, the RAD\u2019s use of the word \u201cconvince\u201d constitutes a clear error of law because it connotes a modification of the standard of proof. [46] Paragraph 33 is the \u201cSummary\u201d of the decision, and reads as follows: The Appellant has failed to convince me that he faces more than a mere possibility of persecution, of cruel or unusual treatment or punishment, or of a risk of torture for a Convention ground. As the Appellant can live safely in Mersin or many other parts of Turkey , his claim would fail as well under section 97(1). [Emphasis added.] [47] The RAD\u2019s use of the word \u201cconvince\u201d was not a statement of a test, but rather a reference to the Applicant\u2019s failure to establish his claim (see, for example, Pararajasingham v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1416 at paras 50-52; Ye v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1221 at paras 17-21). [48] Since the test is correctly articulated in the concluding paragraph, I find that what may have been a rather loose use of words in a few paragraphs does not amount to any confusion on the part of the RAD, nor to a formulation of a stricter test for persecution. VII. Conclusion [49] The Applicant has not convinced me that the intervention of this Court is warranted in the case at bar. In addition, there is no need to supplement the reasons provided by the RAD. Accordingly, I would dismiss the application for judicial review. [50] At the outset of the hearing, counsel for the Applicant raised the possibility of certifying a question, but in the end, none was submitted, and I did not identify one of such importance requiring certification. JUDGMENT in IMM-2852-19 THIS COURT\u2019S JUDGMENT is that: The application for judicial review is dismissed. There is no question for certification. \"Peter G.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : TC012840 TC012841 / TC012842 / TC012843 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and Decision Motifs et decision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW I allow this appeal. Aafia Mahala Shakir (Principal Appellant and mother) and Maha Yasna Younus Shakir, Atif Fahad Younus Shakir, Sajid Naeem Younus Shakir (Minor Associate Appellants and children) are citizens of Pakistan. They claim that as Shia Muslims they face persecution in Pakistan. In addition, the Principal Appellant faces domestic violence. Having reviewed the record, the appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees. BACKGROUND The Principal Appellant was born on March 28, 1977. She and her children base their claim on the following. The Principal Appellant lived in Karachi. She was a Sunni Muslim. She went to university and received a Bachelor of Medical Science. However, she did not work. She also attended a finance course and there she met her husband. She converted to the Shia religion to be with the husband, and they got married in 2001. Initially, they lived with his family. They had three children, the Minor Associate Appellants, born in 2002, 2003 and 2006. Relations with the family were not harmonious. The Principal Appellant\u2019s mother-in-law criticized her and at times was physically abusive with her. The family of her husband wanted the the children to be strict Shia Muslims and participate in rituals; including one where the children must engage in self mortification. Further, they wanted her to wear a hijab and it was clear they would want her daughter to do so as well. In 2006, the Appellant\u2019s husband started to become abusive. The Principal Appellant accused him of having an affair and he became violent. From then on, there were incidents of abuse. The Principal Appellant felt that she could do nothing to help herself. His family did not stop him and the culture in Pakistan did not give her options to deal with the situation. The children witnessed the violence. In 2012, the husband received a threat because of his Shia beliefs. He was at work when he received a threatening e-mail and had to be taken to the hospital because of his reaction. In a separate incident in 2015, the husband\u2019s uncle was driving in the husband\u2019s car. The car was shot at and the driver was killed. The husband was supposed to be in the car but had stayed home because one of his children was sick. The Appellants left Pakistan in February 2015. Their claims were refused by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). They appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) who referred the appeal back to the RPD. The RPD held a hearing over the course of two sittings, on December 18, 2019 and on March 9, 2020. It found that there was insufficient credible evidence that the Appellants were Convention refugees and/or persons in need of protection. The Appellants have appealed to the RAD. This is the appeal that is now before me. The Appellants did not submit any new evidence, nor have they requested a new hearing. As there is not any new evidence, the RAD does not have jurisdiction to hold a hearing. ANALYSIS I have conducted an independent assessment of the evidence and arguments. This review includes reviewing transcripts of the entire hearing. A recording of the hearing is on record. The RAD has considered the most recent National Documentation Package (NDP) at the time of writing the decision; namely that of April 16, 2021, as a forward-looking risk is being assessed. I have also considered the Chairperson Guidelines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (Gender Guidelines) while assessing this appeal. The domestic violence occurred I find that the RPD erred when it found that there was not sufficient credible evidence that the domestic violence occurred. Rather, I find that the Principal Appellant did undergo domestic abuse while she lived in Pakistan. The evidence on this point is consistent. The Principal Appellant\u2019s testimony, the testimony of the two Minor Associate Appellants who testified, the updated narrative in the Basis of Claim (BOC) form, and the letter from the brother, all attest to a history of domestic violence. The Principal Appellant provided credible detail about the violence, such as it beginning in 2006 when she accused her husband of having an affair. She was also credible in that she stated that the last incident was in April 2014. She did not try to exaggerate or mislead the RPD by stating that it was ongoing until she left. The Principal Appellant\u2019s testimony is also consistent with the psychiatric evidence on record. The psychiatrist saw the Appellant and her son, the minor Associate Appellant. They provided consistent evidence about the emotional and physical abuse that the Principal Appellant underwent. The psychiatrist provided three detailed reports about the Principal Appellant and her son. She notes that the Principal Appellant presented as highly traumatized; this is an observation that is consistent with the account of abuse. I give these psychiatric reports significant weight. They are lengthy and detailed. They are grounded in observations about the Principal Appellant and her son, when she herself met with them and assessed them. The psychiatrist\u2019s area of interest is working with marginalized families and children where there is exposure to domestic abuse. This is a reliable document from a credible source. I find that the RPD erred when it took a negative inference from the Principal Appellant\u2019s failure to disclose to the abuse when she completed the first BOC form narrative. The domestic violence was disclosed in the second narrative. The Principal Appellant stated that she was with her father when she completed the first BOC form narrative and that it was only when she was with a paralegal that she realised that she could make a claim because of the domestic violence. I find that this is consistent with the objective documentary evidence regarding domestic abuse in Pakistan, the evidence on record regarding the behaviour of women who are subject to domestic abuse, and the evidence on record specifically about the Principal Appellant. Specifically, the psychiatrist observes in general that it is common for victims of domestic violence to experience deep shame and to avoid discussing it. I do not find that the failure to disclose the domestic abuse immediately weighs against the likelihood it occurred. The Principal Appellant\u2019s account of domestic abuse is consistent with the objective documentary evidence on record. Pakistan has been ranked the sixth most dangerous country in the world for women and it is noted by sources that violence against women, including domestic violence, is increasing. About a third of women experience intimate partner violence. One study with men described it as \u201cwidespread\u201d and noted that 49.4% of men reported it, while 77% reported engaging in non-consensual sex, and almost 60% reported they would kill an unfaithful wife. Further, about 80% of women who experienced spousal abuse stay with their partner. This is consistent with the evidence that Pakistan is the deep rooted patriarchal society where gender roles play a strong part in social structure and there are rigid expectations regarding a wife\u2019s behaviour. I give this evidence significant weight. It is well-researched and from neutral, respected sources. I find it shows a culture where domestic violence is prevalent and accepted. I do not take a negative inference from the Principal Appellant re-availing herself of Pakistan and staying with her husband. The Principal Appellant took holidays and returned to Pakistan. To conclude that the abuse could not have occurred because the Principal Appellant returned to him when she could have left him is to follow the mythology about domestic violence. The cyclical nature of abuse, the psychological barriers to leaving are well-documented. Women typically leave and return to abusive relationships about five times before they finally leave it. People who sustain domestic abuse become dependent on the abuser. The barriers to leave in a patriarchal culture where women are financially, socially, and professionally disempowered are even more pronounced. The Principal Appellant was not working, was financially dependant on her husband, and had three children to provide for. Additionally, in this case, the expert evidence of the psychiatrist addresses why the Appellant did not leave her husband. Dr. Taleb describes \u201ccycle of abuse\u201d and that it is a cycle that continues because there is a power imbalance in a relationship which is what the Principle Appellant is experiencing regarding her husband. Also, I find that it is speculative to assume that the husband has lost interest in the Appellants. The Principal Appellant testified that she and the Minor Associate Appellants have regular contact with the husband, who is being nice to them as he wants to go to Canada. Clearly, he still has an interest. Further, I accept the contention that because there are sons, he is particularly interested. The husband and his family have shown an interest in the religious upbringing of the Minor Associate Appellants. While the Principal Appellant testified that there had not been abuse since April 2014, she was only with him a few months after that; she left Pakistan in February 2015. She was only accessible to him for a period of a few months. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the husband would not continue to take an interest in the Appellants. Granted, the testimony is not perfect. The Principal Appellant testified several times that she could not remember details of incidents. However, I have considered this flaw in the evidence in the context of all of the evidence; I find that there is psychiatric evidence that addresses it. The psychiatrist report dated April 12, 2015 states that: Trauma often affects one\u2019s memory and recall of events. The effect of fear, threat or states of intense stress on memory can result in intensified memory recollection, or it can result in fragmented or impaired memories. When high levels of the stress hormone cortisol are secreted, along with adrenaline, the hippocampus super-encodes these intense early moments of the event. Following this, if the threat or fear continues, the hippocampus continues to be flooded with stress hormones and it is temporarily impaired, affecting storage of information. Therefore, there may be minimal encoding affecting an individual\u2019s memory of specific details or events of an incident related to sexual assault or other kinds of trauma producing events. The patient has provided accounts of both physical and mental abuse infliclted on her by her husband, all of which, in my opinion, can produce trauma that would impair her memory of specific details of an individual incident. I accept that there were barriers for the Principal Appellant to provide a fulsome testimony. I find that the Principal Appellant\u2019s testimony is credible. For these reasons, I find that it is more likely than not that the domestic violence occurred. Further, documentary evidence even supports the Appellants\u2019 claim that the husband\u2019s family, notably her mother-in-law, have been violent with her. It also supports the likelihood that the family would not try to stop the physical abuse. It also supports a finding that the abuse would continue if the Appellants return to Pakistan. The children are also Convention refugees. The Appellants have argued that the RPD erred when it did not conduct an independent assessment of the children\u2019s claims, including the additional parts of the claims that they raised. The claims of the minor children are dependent on that of the Principal Appellant. In addition, the cumulative effect of the issues that these minor Associate Appellants face are such that they are a tantamount to serious harm in Pakistan. I have come to this conclusion for the following reason. The Appellants have argued that they face a forward-looking risk because of the domestic abuse. The RPD noted that the Minor Associate Appellants would \u201cnot face serious harm at the hands of their father for any reason.\u201d I have considered whether the Minor Associate Appellants would face serious harm. The claims of the Minor Associate Appellants are based upon those of their mother, the Principal Appellant; they have claims as family members of the Principal Appellant\u2019s claim. It is evidence from the record that the Minor Associate Appellants have witnessed domestic violence and that they have experience harm from it. The Minor Associate Appellants are children who witness the domestic violence in their mother\u2019s claim and have sustained harm as a result of that characteristic in their lives. The evidence on record supports a finding that children sustain harm as a result of witnessing domestic violence. This can result in behaviour, emotional and somatic problems. The Principal Appellant testified her son witnessed his father beating his mother. Dr. Taleb assessed the oldest minor Associate Appellant, Atif, and wrote a report dated April 14, 2015. In it, she wrote that the Associate Appellant was \u201coften exposed to violence against his mother, including verbal and physical abuse which could impact his own mental health.\u201d Further, while he was not exhibiting significant symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, given his experience he was vulnerable to develop these disorders unless he could live with stability and safety. She notes that if the family returns to Pakistan, the \u201ccycle of violence and oppression\u201d will continue, and it will be difficult for him to have a healthy development trajectory. I find that this evidence demonstrates the damaging effect that domestic violence has had on the Minor Associate Appellant. While the report only relates to one of the Minor Associate Appellants, it is more likely than not that all the children who witnessed this violence would have similar damaging experiences with it. In the event that the Appellants return to Pakistan, they are likely to witness more domestic violence and suffering, and even more harm because of it. I have considered a forward-looking risk assessment. Given that I have found that domestic violence is likely to continue in the event that the Principal Appellant returns to Pakistan, and that it is more likely than not that her children will be with her, I also find that it is more likely than not that the children will witness domestic violence and sustain harm because of it. This harm contributes to the cumulative harmful effect of returning to Pakistan. In addition, I find that it is likely that the husband\u2019s family wants the sons to participate in a ritual that is potentially dangerous and could harm them. The weight of the evidence supports this finding. The Principal Appellant\u2019s testimony, the letter from the brother, and the testimony of the male minor Associate Appellant, all support the allegation that the husband\u2019s family is putting pressure on the sons to participate in a dangerous ritual during the period of mourning (Moharram). There is sufficient credible evidence that the daughter will face pressure to wear a hijab in Pakistan. Further, she testified that she was worried that her father would not let her attend university in the same manner that he did not allow her mother to work. I find it likely that the children face social isolation at school. While this is a minor concern, it is consistent with the documentary evidence that states that there are derogatory comments about the Shia Muslims present in some of the textbooks. Clearly, this alone would not be sufficient to find that the Minor Associate Appellants are Convention refugees. However, it is another consideration which adds in a cumulative manner to the type of serious harm that these Appellants and their circumstances would face in Pakistan. The fact that the claims of the Minor Associate Appellants are reliant on that of their mother, and the consequences for their Shia faith in Pakistan, are sufficient to find that the Minor Associate Appellants are Convention refugees. I find that the risks Minor Associate Appellants face are tantamount to a serious harm should they return to Pakistan. State Protection In their Appeal Memorandum, the Appellants argue that the Pakistani authorities have shown that they are unable and unwilling to provide state protection. I find that it is unlikely that adequate state protection is available to the Appellants. There is objective evidence that provides clear and convincing proof to counter a presumption of state protection. The police are known to be unhelpful in matters of domestic violence and the justice system has \u201cdone little to end violence against women.\u201d This is not surprising in a system where the value of a woman\u2019s court testimony is half that of a male witness. A symptom of the lack of state protection is the chronic under-reporting, although this may be improving. Overall, there is consistent objective evidence from a variety of reliable and unrelated sources that state that state protection would not be available to the Appellants. No IFA in Islamabad The RPD found that the Appellants have an IFA in Islamabad. This location was properly raised at the hearing and Appellants had the burden of proof to show that there is not a viable IFA available. However, there still must be sufficient evidence to show that there is not as serious possibility of persecution in any IFA location and that it is not unreasonable, or unduly harsh, for the Appellants to relocate and live there. The test for assessing an IFA is two-pronged and is set out in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Rasaratnam: The Board must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country to which it finds an IFA exists and/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA. Moreover, the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for him to seek refuge there. Both prongs must be satisfied to find that an Appellant has an Internal Flight Alternative (IFA). Once the issue of IFA has been raised and the potential IFAs have been identified, the burden of proof rests with the appellant to show that he/she does not have an IFA. The finding of an IFA must be based on a distinct evaluation of the region for that purpose taking into account an appellant\u2019s personal circumstances. An IFA must be a realistic and attainable option. An appellant cannot be required to encounter great physical danger or undergo undue hardship in traveling there and staying there. The hardship associated with relocation is not the kind of undue hardship that renders an IFA unreasonable. The standard is high and requires proof of adverse conditions which would jeopardize the life and safety of the claimant in travelling to and in living in the IFA location. Is there a serious possibility of persecution in Islamabad? The Principal Appellant testified that her husband had friends that live in Islamabad. He visits Islamabad. He has his headquarters in Islamabad. She believes that because he has connections with the Income Tax Department, he could find her. The evidence regarding the connections with the Income Tax Department is vague. However, I accept the evidence that the husband, or the agent of persecution, travels to Islamabad. This in and of itself may not be sufficient to find there is a serious possibility of persecution in Islamabad as well as in Pakistan is general. However, an IFA must also be reasonable for the Appellants to relocate and live there. In other words, they must not face conditions and issues that are unduly harsh in their attempts to travel there and live there. Is it reasonable for the opponents to relocate and live in Islamabad? I find that it is not reasonable for the Appellants to relocate and live in Islamabad or in any location in Pakistan. I have considered the Gender Guidelines, which indicate that a decision-maker should consider the economic, social and cultural factors, in determining the reasonableness of an IFA. I find that for these Appellants in their circumstances it would be unduly harsh for them to relocate and live in Islamabad or, for that matter, in any location in Pakistan. Cultural Factors Given the objective documentary evidence, there are cultural reasons why it is unlikely that the Principal Appellant would be able to provide for herself and others. Pakistan is a patriarchal society, and next to impossible for a single woman\u201d to live alone in Pakistan due to prejudices against women and economic dependence.\u201d It is not socially acceptable for women to live alone. While it may be easier in some large cities, and it may be easier for educated women with resources, it was still known as a rare occurrence and divorcees face stigmatisation and social rejection. The Principal Appellant and her family would be dependent on family support. It is speculative to conclude that she would have this support. For these reasons, I find that there is sufficient evidence to find that the Principal Appellant would face significant cultural barriers that would interfere with her ability to provide for herself and her children. There are also economic considerations. Accommodation It is unlikely that the Principal Appellant would be able to find accommodation for her and her children. There are difficulties for single women renting property. Because of stereotypes and social norms, it is not favourable for women to work and live alone. People are hesitant to rent property. While there are hostels for working women, space is very limited. It is unlikely that a single mother with three children will find accommodation. This would constitute undue hardship. Employment This Appellant has employable attributes. She can communicate in English. She has a Bachelor of Science. However, she has never worked until she came to Canada. At the time of the hearings, she had a paid position where she helped with administering health care services, including a nursing position. However, this evidence is not sufficient to find that it is likely that she could find sufficient work in Pakistan, as she would face additional barriers there. Overall, women in Pakistan are in a significantly vulnerable position. According to the UK home office: The HRCP 2018 report noted \u2018While women\u2019s labour force participation in Pakistan has increased by more than 50 percent over the past 15 years, only one out of every five women participates in the labour force. Approximately 75% of women and girls were employed in the agricultural sector. Unemployment was reported to be 7% amongst rural women and 20% of urban women. The Women, Peace and Security Index 2017/18 noted only 3% of women in Pakistan were estimated to have financial accounts. Microfinance schemes were available to women, particularly supporting those living in rural areas. Overall, 11% of households were female-headed. [References not included] The Principal Appellant would be a single mother providing for herself and her three children. She would need significant resources to do so. Even with her education, and with some work experience, I find that it is unlikely that the Principal Appellant would find employment in this climate. This would lead to undue hardship. Summary for Reasonableness I find that these considerations are not limited to Islamabad; rather, they are pervasive throughout Pakistan. There are economic and cultural factors in the assessment of the reasonableness of an IFA in Pakistan that show it to be unduly harsh for the Appellants to relocate and to live anywhere in Pakistan. Even travelling to the areas would be unduly harsh for a single woman, especially one with the responsibilities of travelling alone with three minor children. It is not reasonable for the Minor Associate Appellants to relocate in Pakistan because of their dependency on a mother who cannot do so. For these reasons, it is not reasonable for the Appellant to relocate and live in Pakistan. There is not an IFA available to them. CONCLUSION The appeal is allowed. I substitute my own decision that the Appellants are Convention refugees.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Aafia Mahala Shakir', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 35, 'end': 38}, {'text': 'Maha Yasna Younus Shakir', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 45, 'end': 49}, {'text': 'Atif Fahad Younus Shakir', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 50, 'end': 54}, {'text': 'Sajid Naeem Younus Shakir', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 55, 'end': 59}, {'text': 'March 28', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 122, 'end': 124}, {'text': 'Medical Science', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 160, 'end': 162}, {'text': 'finance', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 174, 'end': 175}, {'text': 'February', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 482, 'end': 483}, {'text': 'April', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 851, 'end': 852}, {'text': 'Taleb', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1564, 'end': 1565}, {'text': 'cycle of abuse', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1567, 'end': 1570}, {'text': 'a cycle that continues because there is a power imbalance in a relationship which is what the Principle Appellant is experiencing regarding her husband', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1575, 'end': 1599}, {'text': 'April', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1708, 'end': 1709}, {'text': 'February', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1726, 'end': 1727}, {'text': 'April 12', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 1820, 'end': 1822}, {'text': 'Trauma often affects one\u2019s memory and recall of events.

{"doc_text": " RAD File / Dossier de la SAR : MC011075 MC011076 / MC011077 / MC011078 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW Manuel Rafael Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez (Principal Appellant) and Tatiana Catalina Amaya Aguilar, Milena Aguilar Vel\u00e1squez, Patricia Aguilar Vel\u00e1squez (Associate Appellants) are citizens of Colombia. They fear a criminal group, the Black Eagles, due to Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez involvement in the 2014 and 2018 regional elections in Santander. Their claim was denied by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) based on credibility findings. The Appellants allege that the COVID-19 measures imposed at the RPD hearing created an unfair hearing and led to adverse findings against them. They also argue that the RPD failed to understand their evidence and to apply the presumption of truth or the benefit of the doubt to their evidence. DECISION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in finding that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. BACKGROUND The Appellants fear a criminal group in Columbia, the Black Eagles, due to Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez involvement in the Colombian Conservative Party (PCC). Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez and Ms. Amaya Aguilar were members of the PCC from October 2012 to February 2018. The applicants allege that they were threatened by armed men in September 2014 and in May 2018 after the regional elections of those years. The Appellants left Colombia for the United States in June 2018, entered Canada illegally on June 24, 2018, and claimed refugee status shortly thereafter. The Appellants indicate that they are not presenting new evidence but have provided an affidavit from Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez. This affidavit relates his views and feelings about the RPD decision but does not contain new facts or other evidence. I have considered this affidavit as part of the Appellants\u2019 memorandum of argument. The Appellants are requesting an oral hearing. As there is no new evidence, I do not have jurisdiction to convene an oral hearing. At the outset of the hearing, the RPD confirmed that the claim of the Associate Appellants was based on the events surrounding Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez, specifically that there were no independent bases of claim for the other Appellants. Having reviewed the oral and documentary evidence, I agree that there are no other grounds for the claims of the Associate Appellants. ANALYSIS My role is to look at all the evidence and decide if the RPD made the correct decision. The RPD found that the Appellants were not credible about the following key elements of their claim: The Appellants had little knowledge of the regional elections of the City of Otanche in which Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez participated. Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez was not able to give the name of the mayor of Bucaramanga, the number of people on the regional council or the name of any candidates. He incorrectly cited the years of the two elections in which he campaigned. His party membership card had no dates of issue nor of expiration. He was not able to name the person who was the president of the party when he joined it, even though that person\u2019s name was on the membership card. The Appellants appear to have no knowledge of the Black Eagles group. The Appellants testified that the Black Eagles could be found everywhere in Columbia while the objective evidence indicates that they are found in a select few areas. Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez was unable to name the candidates supported by the Black Eagles in any of the elections. In his denunciation to the police in 2014, Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez does not attribute the death threats to the Black Eagles. Similarly, Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez indicated that the men did not identify themselves as Black Eagles in any of the 2014 or 2018 events. Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez believed the assailants to have been members of the Black Eagles based on information from his father-in-law. The father-in-law had not seen or heard the assailants but spoke to community contacts. The RPD found that this third-hand information was speculative about the identity of the assailants. Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez had not inquired into the status of the police investigations into his complaints and did not know why they had been classified as \u201cinactive\u201d by the police. He indicated that it is typical for Columbian police to ignore or to downplay complaints unless a person is dead. The RPD found that the anonymous calls were received by Ms. Amaya Aguilar (and not by Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez) and that some of these calls could not be attributed to the Black Eagles. I also note that one of the police reports indicates that these calls may have come from a company selling cellular packages. The RPD also found that the documentary evidence showed that the Black Eagles name was often used by multiple unrelated and unstructured groups (including street gangs). The RPD found that the Black Eagles were not a unified and cohesive criminal group. COVID-19 Measures The Appellants argue that the safety measures established by the IRB in light of the COVID-19 pandemic prevented them from presenting their evidence, from being well understood and from having a fair hearing. In light of the exceptional nature of the global pandemic, I find that there was no breach of natural justice during the RPD hearing. The safety measures at the RPD hearing included mandatory masks for all persons in the room; plexiglass sheets between the RPD member, the translator and the Appellants; maintaining a distance of more than two metres between the parties; and mandatory use of hand sanitizer when entering and exiting the room. These measures were installed by direction of the Chairperson, established in accordance with federal legislation,and pursuant to directions and recommendations from the Public Health Agency of Canada. During the RPD hearing Appellants\u2019 counsel requested that the Appellants be able to remove their masks in order to facilitate their testimony. The RPD allowed this request in accordance with the IRB\u2019s COVID-19 health and safety measures. The RPD member and interpreter remained masked and behind plexiglass throughout the Appellants\u2019 testimony. The Appellants argue that the wearing of a mask was not required by the Quebec provincial order. I note the hearing was held in a federal hearing room by a federal department. I find that there was no error in the RPD following the mandatory directives imposed by the Chairperson in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Appellant argues that wearing a mask affected the Appellant\u2019s ability to communicate. The directive imposed by the Chairperson allowed the RPD member, in his discretion, to allow the Appellant to remove his mask to testify. It appears that the RPD allowed the Appellants to remove their masks for the entirety of their testimony. In reviewing the audio recording and the decision, I find that the RPD or the interpreter did not have difficulties hearing the Appellant. The interpreter did not indicate to the RPD that she was having difficulties hearing or performing her task due to wearing a mask. The RPD found that the Appellant could not express himself clearly for reasons unrelated to the mask. For example, the Appellant did not answer the questions directly or give contradictory or unclear answers. These difficulties in his testimony were not caused by the wearing of a mask and could have happened without a mask. The Appellant argues that wearing a mask affected the Appellants\u2019 ability to know how their testimony was being received. The Appellant has provided no caselaw on the right for an applicant or accused person or a witness to be able to see the face of the decision-maker. I have also not found any authorities for this proposition. I note, first of all, the hearing was held following the mandatory directives imposed by the Chairperson in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic. Being in a hearing room, for multiple hours, with at least four other people, requires the simple measures of social distancing and wearing a mask, especially in the face of the evolving knowledge about the propagation of the virus by aerosol. In these difficult times, the Appellant\u2019s natural justice rights must be balanced against the competing and broader societal interest in public health in a worldwide pandemic. The Appellants argue that wearing a mask during a hearing was a breach of natural justice. In the exceptional circumstances of a global pandemic, I find that this argument is without merit. The Appellants had a hearing with all the parties present. The Appellants were able to remove their masks to facilitate their testimony. In reviewing the audio recording, I note that the RPD rephrased or restated his questions as necessary. The RPD confronted the Appellant with the inconsistencies or omissions in his testimony and gave him an opportunity to respond. The interpreter clarified the Appellant\u2019s responses on multiple occasions. While I acknowledge that the hearing conditions were not ideal, I also find that the ability of the Appellant to know the facial reactions of the RPD member or of the interpreter is not relevant to the determination of credibility. It is not the member or the interpreter who have the onus of establishing their claim. I am mindful of the Supreme Court of Canada caselaw on demeanour evidence in the context of witness\u2019 testimony. Wearing a niqab presents only a partial obstacle to the assessment of demeanour. A witness wearing a niqab may still express herself through her eyes, body language, and gestures. Moreover, the niqab has no effect on the witness\u2019 verbal testimony, including the tone and inflection of her voice, the cadence of her speech, or, most significantly, the substance of the answers she gives. I also note that adjudicators are often trained to show no reaction and not to take cultural cues, such as facial reactions, into account in their decisions. Having reviewed the audio hearing, I find that there were numerous sources of information available to the Appellant and their counsel about the RPD\u2019s concerns about their evidence: the RPD\u2019s tone inflection and cadence, the requests to repeat answers, the rephrasing of questions, not to mention his statements when he did not understand the Appellants. I find that there was no breach of natural justice in having the RPD member and the interpreter wear a mask and sit behind plexiglass for the hearing. Interpretation The Appellants argue that the interpretation was not adequate. I have already addressed the part of this argument that deals with the impact of the COVID-19 measures on the interpretation. The Federal Court of Appeal in Mohammadian establishes that a claimant waives his rights if he fails to object to the quality of the language interpretation during the hearing before the RPD. There was no such objection during the RPD hearing. As was pointed out by the Supreme Court, \"the underlying principle behind all of the interests protected by the right to interpreter assistance \u2026.. is that of linguistic understanding\". The principles surrounding interpretation have been summarized by the Federal Court The interpretation must be precise, continuous, competent, impartial and contemporaneous. No proof of actual prejudice is required as a condition of obtaining relief. The right is to adequate translation not perfect translation. The fundamental value is linguistic understanding. Waiver of the right results if an objection to the quality of the translation is not raised by a claimant at the first opportunity in those cases where it is reasonable to expect that a complaint be made. It is a question of fact in each case whether it is reasonable to expect that a complaint be made about the inadequacy of interpretation. If the interpreter is having difficulty speaking an applicant\u2019s language and being understood by him it is a matter which should be raised at the earliest opportunity. I have reviewed the audio hearing. I have found one instance where the RPD questioned whether the Appellant was understanding the translation and one instance where the interpreter expressed her opinion that the Appellant did not speak Spanish very well. I agree that the interpretation was not, at all times, a word-for-word translation as the translator would ask clarifying questions or listen to a large block of testimony before translating it. The translator commented that the Appellant did not express himself well in Spanish and the RPD member indicated that he would take this into consideration in his decision. The Appellant responded that he was stressed as this was his first experience in a court. I also find that the translator\u2019s insistence that she be allowed to take a break after the RPD\u2019s questions were entirely reasonable. At that point, she had been translating detailed testimony for more than 1.5 hours. I find that the difficulties expressed by the Appellant in his affidavit cannot be attributed to problems with the interpreter. The Appellant had difficulty answering precise questions. There were three instances during the hearing where the translator was unable to provide a clear translation: there is only one of these that could be attributed to a translation problem. These instances are: Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez was asked what candidate was supported by the Black Eagles in the election and instead explained that the Black Eagles controlled the village and he was campaigning to take back the village; he was asked what event was the most critical or important for him and instead summarized all the events; he was asked to explain a contradiction in his evidence, being that he had testified to moving (\u201cd\u00e9menagement\u201d) to Bogota after the assault in 2014 while his written evidence showed that he already lived in Bogota at the time of the 2014 assaults. Instead of answering the question, Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez explained why he had a US visa, when he visited his family, what threats had been made to his wife, etc. Even for this last issue, I have difficulty in agreeing that the translation may have affected the testimony. Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez did not answer the question despite being given several opportunities to do so. Having reviewed the oral and written evidence, I am satisfied that the interpretation services provided to the Appellant did not result in any linguistic misunderstanding between the Appellant and the RPD panel. The Appellant has failed to demonstrate how the conclusions drawn by the RPD, particularly regarding his crediblity were due to alleged interpretation errors rather than shortcomings in his testimony. I am satisfied that the interpretation services did not result in linguistic misunderstanding so as to breach the Appellant\u2019s right to procedural fairness. Presumption of Truth and Credibility Findings The Appellants argue that the RPD erred in its findings that the Appellants were not credible. They argue that they were held to a higher standard of proof and the RPD erroneously impugned their credibility for their lack of knowledge of the Black Eagles group, a group of which they were not a part and concerning which they had little immediate knowledge. The RPD also erred in its assessment of the Appellants\u2019 evidence, rejecting documents for what they did not say rather than for what they did say. The Appellants argue that the RPD did not sufficiently rebut the presumption of truthfulness and relied on peripheral inconsistencies and omissions in order to do so. Further, the Appellants argue that the RPD refused to accept the Appellants\u2019 reasonable explanations for these alleged omissions and inconsistencies. The RPD found that there were numerous omissions, inconsistencies and gaps in the Appellants\u2019 testimony as set out above. In Maldonado, the Federal Court of Appeal held that when an applicant swears to the truth of certain allegations, a presumption is created that those allegations are true unless there is reason to doubt their truthfulness. This presumption applies to the totality of the evidence. However, as the Federal Court has noted, \u201cThe presumption is rebuttable where the evidence on the record is inconsistent with a claimant\u2019s sworn testimony.\u201d As I will explain, I find that the presumption has been rebutted because of the multiple contradictions, ambiguities and omissions in his testimony. As a matter of law, it is open to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) and the RPD to draw negative inferences from a material omission or a contradiction in testimony. A material omission is an element that is central to the claim, including the risks allegedly faced in the country of origin. In this case, I find that there are several unexplained omissions and contradictions which affect the credibility of this claim. While I agree with the Appellants that each individual one of these omissions or contradictions is not determinative, I find that, taken as a group, these omissions and contradictions negatively affect the credibility of these claims. Political knowledge and electoral information The Appellant testified that the elections were held at the beginning of 2018 but could not recall the month of the regional elections. He later testified that the elections happened around the middle of the year but he was not a candidate for the election himself. This is a key issue as the Appellants\u2019 claim is based on their political involvement. It is an important inconsistency that Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez was not able to provide information about the electoral campaigns for which he collected information and distributed publicity materials. The RPD returned to this topic twice and the Appellant was not able to provide a month or year of the elections. He was not able to provide the names of any other candidates, the name of the mayor of the region in 2014 or how many people were on the council. I also find that it is reasonable that a political operative would know the names of the opposing candidates and the incumbent politicians. The Appellant did not have a response when the RPD member confronted him with information that municipal elections were held in 2015 and 2019, and not in 2014 and 2018 as testified by the Appellant. He could not provide the name of the head of the Conservative party when he joined the party in 2012, although the card indicated a name with the title of \u201cpresident\u201d on the card. These facts are important as the Appellants allege that the assaults and threats from the Black Eagles were a result of their political involvement. If the assaults and threats preceded the period of campaigning for the elections, the link between the threat to the Appellant and their political involvement becomes tenuous. Police investigations The Appellants argue that their credibility was impugned based on the police decision to stop the investigation. Having reviewed the decision and the audio recording of the hearing, I find that the RPD did not impugn the Appellants\u2019 credibility based on the actions of the police. Rather, the RPD questioned the Appellants\u2019 failure to follow up on their complaints made in 2014 or in 2018. I agree that this failure undermines the Appellants\u2019 allegation of fear from the Black Eagles. The Appellants\u2019 credibility on this point is further undermined by Mr. Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez\u2019s testimony that he did not flee with his valid US visa after 2014 as he was waiting for or relying on the investigation of the 2014 assault. Black Eagles The Appellants argue that their credibility was impugned based on their knowledge of the Black Eagles. I agree that it is possible that the police did not include the name of the Black Eagles in their report for reasons unrelated to the Appellants. However, in reviewing the audio recording, I note that the Appellant testified that the assailants in 2014 did not identify themselves as Black Eagles. The RPD did not err in their finding that the police report did not support the Appellants\u2019 allegation that they were assaulted by the Black Eagles in 2014. I also find that the RPD was correct in its findings about the Appellants\u2019 knowledge of the Black Eagles. The Appellants were asked questions relative to their risk in Columbia as it relates to the Black Eagles. For example, the Appellants testified that the Black Eagles were everywhere in Columbia and that they would be at risk across Columbia. When confronted with the NDP evidence that the Black Eagles had limited geographic reach and were not an organized group nor a single group, the Appellants did not answer the question. I find that these questions were relevant and related to their belief about their risk in Columbia. I also note that there were multiple areas which led the RPD to a negative finding of credibility: even if I were to agree that the Appellants could not have known much information about the Black Eagles, I find that there were other sufficient areas, as discussed above, which support the negative findings on credibility. I find that the RPD made no errors in its assessments in regards to the Appellants\u2019 political knowledge or opinions, police investigations and knowledge of the Black Eagles. Standard of Proof The Appellants argue that the RPD applied a higher standard of proof to their claim than set out in the law. They do not provide specifics about where this error occurred. Rule 3(3)(g) of the RAD Rules requires that claimants indicate the errors that are the grounds of the appeal and where those errors are located in the RPD\u2019s decision or recording of the hearing. I have reviewed the oral and written evidence and have not found where the RPD applied an unfair or improper standard of proof. To be clear, I have noted paragraphs 20 and 41 of the RPD decision where the RPD stated its conclusions about the risk of the Appellants based on their political opinions. The conclusions at para 41 are stated correctly using the correct legal tests and standard of proof and I find that there is no error. In addition, the Appellant submits that he should be given the \u201cbenefit of the doubt.\u201d Respectfully, I find that the Appellant has not demonstrated the merits of this argument. The Supreme Court of Canada has cited with approval the following from the UNHCR Handbook: The benefit of the doubt should, however, only be given when all available evidence has been obtained and checked and when the examiner is satisfied as to the applicant\u2019s general credibility. The applicant\u2019s statements must be coherent and plausible, and must not run counter to generally known facts. I find that the Appellants have not established their general credibility such that they should be afforded the benefit of this general principle. Finally, the Appellants have provided submissions about the possibility of an internal flight alternative (IFA). As the RPD had found, and as I have found, the Appellants have not established the fundamentals of their claim: their political activity, the assaults and threats against them and their political profile. I find that I do not need to consider their argument about the viability of an IFA. CONCLUSION After conducting an independent analysis of the record, I find that the overall credibility assessment by the RPD was correct. I find that the Appellants have not demonstrated that they face a serious possibility of persecution on a Convention ground. I further find that they have not demonstrated, on a balance of probabilities, that they face a risk of torture, a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I dismiss the appeal and confirm the decision of the RPD that the Appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection, pursuant to paragraph 111(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.", "spans": "[{'text': 'Manuel Rafael Vanegas Vel\u00e1squez', 'label': 'REDACTED', 'start': 30, 'end': 34}, {'text': 'Tatiana Catalina Amaya Aguilar', 'label': 'REDACTED',

{"doc_text": " Date: 20200109 Docket: IMM-2076-19 Citation: 2020 FC 22 Ottawa, Ontario, January 9, 2020 PRESENT: The Honourable Mr. Justice Gleeson BETWEEN: YENNY DANIELA CRUZ Applicant and THE MINISTER OF CITIZENSHIP AND IMMIGRATION Respondent JUDGMENT AND REASONS I. Overview [1] The Applicant is a citizen of Honduras. The Refugee Protection Division [RPD] of the Immigration and Refugee Board refused her claim for protection on the basis that she has an Internal Flight Alternative [IFA] in Honduras. On appeal, the Refugee Appeal Division [RAD] confirmed the decision of the RPD. [2] She now seeks judicial review of the RAD decision pursuant to subsection 72(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27, [IRPA]. [3] For the reasons that follow, the application is dismissed. II. Background [4] The Applicant reports that in 2010, while taking a bus to work she witnessed a murder. She believes the assailant saw her and recognized her and now fears that her life is at risk. [5] In the days following the murder she resigned from her factory work and travelled to another city in Honduras to visit her two children who were being cared for by her grandmother. She then fled Honduras arriving in the United States in 2011 where she gave birth to a son in 2014. In 2017 she left the United States and came to Canada claiming protection for herself and her son. III. The Decision under Review [6] The RAD noted that the issue raised on appeal was whether the RPD had erred in concluding, on a balance of probabilities, that there is no serious possibility of the Applicant being harmed in the proposed IFAs of Choluteca or Yuscar\u00e1n. The RAD then briefly reviewed the facts as disclosed in the Applicant\u2019s narrative and stated that it agreed with the RPD\u2019s conclusion that the Applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution on a Convention ground and that her risk was to be assessed pursuant to section 97 of the IRPA. [7] In assessing the possibility of harm in the identified IFAs, the RAD noted that the individual the Applicant feared had made no contact with the Applicant\u2019s family, had not attempted to locate the Applicant, and is not alleged to have any criminal associations that would improve his ability to locate the Applicant. [8] The RAD acknowledged the possibility of a chance encounter with the individual should the Applicant return to Honduras but concluded that there was little likelihood \u201cof a chance of such an encounter where the assailant also recognizes the Appellant given the time that has passed\u201d. The RAD also acknowledged the possibility that the assailant would be motivated to silence the Applicant but found there was no evidence to indicate an intent to harm or an ability to locate her in the identified IFAs. In considering the Applicant\u2019s evidence to the effect that the proposed IFAs would not be reasonable because she did not have family in these locations, the RAD noted that she had previously lived alone in Honduras and had resided in the United States and Canada for many years without close proximity to family. IV. Issues [9] I have framed the issues as follows: Did the RAD err in its IFA analysis by: not clearly articulating the applicable standard of proof? failing to consider and address relevant factors? Is the decision reasonable? V. Standard of Review [10] This application was argued just prior to the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s recent decisions in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 [Vavilov] and Bell Canada v Canada (Attorney General), 2019 SCC 66. The parties submissions on the standard of review were therefore made under the Dunsmuir framework. However, I have applied the Vavilov framework in my consideration of the application. (Dunsmuir v New Brunswick, 2008 SCC 9, [Dunsmuir].) [11] In Canada Post Corp. v Canadian Union of Postal Workers, 2019 SCC 67 [Canada Post] Justice Rowe addressed the circumstance where submissions had been made on the basis of the Dunsmuir framework yet the Court applied the Vavilov framework in determining the matter. Justice Rowe held that submissions from the parties need not be sought and that no unfairness arises where, in applying Vavilov, the applicable standard of review and outcome would have been the same under Dunsmuir (Canada Post at para 24). [12] The parties have taken the position that the decision is reviewable against the standard of reasonableness (Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 719 at para 9). I agree. The presumptive standard of reasonableness applies under either Dunsmuir or Vavilov. [13] The attributes of a reasonable decision were summarized by Justice Rowe in Canada Post where he states: [31] A reasonable decision is \u201cone that is based on an internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain the decision maker\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 85). Accordingly, when conducting reasonableness review \u201c[a] reviewing court must begin its inquiry into the reasonableness of a decision by examining the reasons provided with \u2018respectful attention\u2019 and seeking to understand the reasoning process followed by the decision maker to arrive at [the] conclusion\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 84, quoting Dunsmuir, at para. 48). The reasons should be read holistically and contextually in order to understand \u201cthe basis on which a decision was made\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 97, citing Newfoundland Nurses). [32] A reviewing court should consider whether the decision as a whole is reasonable: \u201cwhat is reasonable in a given situation will always depend on the constraints imposed by the legal and factual context of the particular decision under review\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 90). The reviewing court must ask \u201cwhether the decision bears the hallmarks of reasonableness \u2014 justification, transparency and intelligibility \u2014 and whether it is justified in relation to the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on the decision\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 99, citing Dunsmuir, at paras. 47 and 74, and Catalyst Paper Corp. v. North Cowichan (District), 2012 SCC 2, [2012] 1 S.C.R. 5, at para. 13). [33] Under reasonableness review, \u201c[t]he burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 100). The challenging party must satisfy the court \u201cthat any shortcomings or flaws relied on . . . are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable\u201d (Vavilov, at para. 100). In this case, that burden lies with the Union. [14] In this instance I am also satisfied that my conclusions on the merits of the application would be the same under either framework. I am therefore of the view, having considered the facts, circumstances and the current state of the law that there is no uncertainty as to how the Vavilov decision relates to this application (Vavilov para 144). As was the case in Canada Post, further submissions from the parties are not required to determine the application. I also note that neither party has sought to make further submissions VI. Analysis A. Did the RAD err in its IFA analysis? [15] The Applicant submits that the RAD\u2019s IFA analysis is unreasonable because the RAD\u2019s articulation of the standard of proof used in assessing the first prong of the IFA test is confused, rendering it impossible to determine what standard of proof was applied. The Applicant further argues that the RAD\u2019s failure to address relevant factors in the IFA analysis renders the decision unreasonable. (1) Did the RAD commit a reviewable error by not clearly articulating the standard of proof being applied in its IFA analysis? [16] When assessing an IFA a two prong test is to be applied (Rasaratnum v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1992] 1 FC 706 at para 13): the RAD must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the part of the country in which it finds an IFA exists and/or the claimant would not be personally subject to a risk to life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment or a danger, believed on substantial grounds to exist, of torture in the IFA; and the conditions in the part of the country considered to be an IFA must be such that it would not be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, including those particular to the claim, for the claimant to seek refuge there. [17] At the outset of its IFA analysis the RAD accurately articulated the first prong of the IFA test stating: [8] In order to evaluate the possibility that an IFA exists in Choluteca or Yuscar\u00e1n [\u2026] I must evaluate, on a balance of probabilities, the likelihood that the [Applicant\u2019s] life would be at risk or that she would be subject to cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in these cities. [Emphasis added.] [18] This test is again accurately restated in the following paragraph: [9] While the possibility of a chance encounter between the [Applicant] and the assailant in another part of Honduras is real, on the balance of probabilities, there is little likelihood of a chance of such an encounter where the assailant also recognizes the [Applicant] given the time that has passed. [Emphasis added.] [19] The RAD then states: [10] I find that, on a balance of possibilities, the [Applicant] does not face a risk to her life or a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Choluteca or Yuscaran. [Emphasis added.] [20] The Applicant submits that this final misstatement of the burden of proof, \u201con a balance of possibilities\u201d, is fatal to the reasonableness of the decision because the burden of proof is \u201cthe prism through which the whole claim is examined\u201d. A number of cases are cited to support the Applicant\u2019s view that a misstatement of a legal test is a basis upon which this Court has previously intervened on judicial review (Begollari v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 1340 at para 21, Alam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 4 at para 16). [21] I take no issue with the principle reflected in the above jurisprudence: where a reviewing court is unable to determine what legal test a decision maker applied or where it is clear that an incorrect test was adopted, intervention will normally be warranted. That is not the situation here. [22] As I have set out above, the RAD\u2019s decision, including the RAD\u2019s reference to a \u201cbalance of possibilities\u201d must be assessed within the context of the whole decision (Vavilov at paras 90, 97 and 100, Newfoundland and Labrador Nurses\u2019 Union v. Newfoundland and Labrador (Treasury Board), 2011 SCC 62 at para 14 [Newfoundland Nurses\u2019]). The RAD correctly set out the applicable test, including the standard of proof, when identifying what was to be evaluated, and when applying the test to the circumstances the Applicant indicated she feared: being recognized by the assailant in a chance encounter. I am satisfied that the RAD both understood and applied the proper test in this instance. When read in context the RAD\u2019s misstatement is an error in form, not substance. The error does not undermine the reasonableness of the decision (Singh v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 946 at para 26, citing Martinez Gonzales v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 1504 at para 20). (2) Did the RAD commit a reviewable error by failing to consider and address relevant factors in its IFA analysis? [23] The Applicant submits that the RAD\u2019s failure to address the small size of Honduras and gender specific country conditions renders the decision unreasonable. I disagree. (a) Size of Honduras [24] The size of Honduras within the context of the RAD\u2019s IFA analysis is relevant for two reasons: firstly because the assailant will be able to locate the Applicant with ease and secondly because the assailant and the Applicant may have a \u201cchance encounter\u201d. [25] The RAD does not expressly address the size of the country in considering the IFA issue. However, the RAD benefits from the presumption that it is aware of and has considered all the material before it. This included the RPD\u2019s consideration of Honduras\u2019 size. In addition, the size of the country was not explicitly raised in the Applicant\u2019s submissions to the RAD. Instead, the Applicant challenged the RPD\u2019s conclusions relating to either a chance or deliberate encounter with the assailant, arguments that did not expressly address the size of Honduras. [26] Not surprisingly, the RAD considered the risk of the assailant locating the Applicant in the IFAs and the likelihood of a chance encounter. The RAD turned its mind to the possibility of the assailant becoming aware of her presence in the IFAs, noting the absence of any evidence indicating the assailant had made efforts or had any means to locate her within the IFAs. The RAD acknowledged the possibility of a chance encounter but noted that it was unlikely such an encounter would lead to recognition, given the passage of time. Although the Applicant disagrees with this assessment, I am satisfied that it is was not unreasonable for the RAD to rely on the passage of time in reaching its conclusion. [27] In conducting its analysis, the RAD addressed the very issues that underlie the Applicant\u2019s concerns relating to country size. Having done so, and having recognized and addressed the possibility of a chance encounter in Honduras, it was not unreasonable for the RAD to have not expressly considered the size of the country. (b) Gender specific country conditions [28] The Applicant submits the RAD erred in not addressing gender specific country conditions in its IFA analysis. [29] Before the RPD the Applicant made brief submissions in support of a gender based claim. Those submissions were addressed by the RPD in its decision. The Applicant took no issue with the RPD\u2019s analysis in her appeal to the RAD. In the course of oral submissions on this application counsel for the Applicant stated that the RPD\u2019s consideration of the gender based claim was not raised on appeal because the RPD dealt with the issue in a satisfactory manner. However, the Applicant now argues the RAD unreasonably failed to address this issue in the context of its IFA analysis. [30] An appellant before the RAD must provide full and detailed submissions regarding those errors forming the grounds of appeal and identify where those errors are located in the RPD\u2019s decision (Rule 3(3)(g) of the Refugee Appeal Division Rules, SOR/2012-257). Where an appellant fails to do so the RAD cannot be faulted on judicial review for not having considered or addressed arguments not raised (Adams v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 524 at paragraphs 24 \u2013 29, citing Ghauri v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 548 at para 34). The Applicant did not identify the RPD\u2019s gender based claim analysis as an issue on appeal and, in my opinion, this disposes of the matter. However, and although I had some difficulty in following the argument made, I will comment on the oral submissions by counsel on this issue. [31] As I understand the Applicant\u2019s position, the RAD is not limited to a consideration of the specific issues raised on appeal. Instead, the RAD has the ability to engage in a broad based reconsideration of any issue. In this case, the RAD was not limited to the expressly identified errors in the RPD\u2019s IFA analysis. If I have followed the argument, the Applicant submits that the ability to engage in a broader review allows an applicant to argue on judicial review that failing to engage in that broader analysis is unreasonable and forms a basis upon which to impugn a RAD decision. [32] The RAD is to review decisions of the RPD on a correctness standard (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93 at para 78 [Huruglica]). This does not mean that RAD appeals constitute de novo hearings. Rather, the RAD\u2019s role is to correct the RPD\u2019s errors (Huruglica at para 79). As Justice Alan Diner expressed at para 99 of Rozas del Solar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1145, \u201cthe RAD is tethered to the RPD\u2019s decision\u201d. A RAD decision is not unreasonable merely because it did not canvas each issue canvassed by the RPD. To the contrary, the RAD is deemed to have taken notice of the RPD\u2019s decision in its entirety. [33] The RPD dedicated six paragraphs to the possibility that the Applicant has a gender based claim. If the Applicant felt that the RPD erred in doing so, she should have made submissions to that effect before the RAD (Ghauri v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 548 at para 34). She did not. She cannot now argue that the RAD acted unreasonably by not conducting a gender analysis of its own. On these facts, the Applicant\u2019s argument cannot succeed. B. Is the decision reasonable? [34] The Applicant argues that the RAD\u2019s analysis lacks coherence. She submits that in concluding that \u201cthere is little likelihood of a chance encounter where the assailant recognizes the [Applicant],\u201d it is not clear whether the encounter, the recognition, or both, are unlikely. She also argues that the RAD\u2019s statement that there is no evidence the assailant intends to harm her is inconsistent with its finding that he is motivated to do so\u2014motivation, it is argued, is evidence of intent. [35] The Supreme Court has instructed that reasons need not be perfect (Vavilov at para 91, Newfoundland Nurses\u2019 at para 16) and that judicial review is not a line-by-line treasure hunt for errors; the decision should be approached as an organic whole (Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada, Local 30 v Irving Pulp & Paper, Ltd, 2013 SCC 34 at para 54). [36] The decision in this instance is not perfect; however, I am not persuaded that it lacks in coherence or that the RAD\u2019s findings are inconsistent. The RAD found there to be little likelihood of a chance encounter where the assailant recognizes the Applicant given the passage of time. In my opinion, this finding is clear. [37] Similarly, it is not inconsistent for the RAD to have concluded that the assailant might still have a motivation to harm on the one hand and also note the absence of any evidence of intent to harm on the other. Contrary to what the Applicant has argued motivation to act can exist in the absence of any intent to do so. One need not equate to or follow the other. VII. Conclusion [38] The application is dismissed. The parties have not identified a serious question of general importance for certification and none arises.

{"doc_text": " RAD File No. / No de dossier de la SAR : MC006700 MC006701 / MC006702 / MC006703 Private Proceeding / Huis clos Reasons and decision \u2013 Motifs et d\u00e9cision REASONS FOR DECISION OVERVIEW I dismiss the appeal. Alex Vilgrain, the principal appellant, and Neyssa Vilgrain, the associate appellant, are citizens of Haiti, while Junior Jovais Vilgrain and Fernand Yves Vilgrain, the minor associate appellants, are citizens of Brazil. The male appellant alleges that he encountered problems as a result of a land dispute and of his and his father\u2019s political involvement. He was allegedly persecuted by his father\u2019s rival and by a group of criminals known as Groupe 72, led by the male appellant\u2019s uncle. In September 2013, the male appellant left Haiti for Brazil. Following his departure, these same criminals allegedly continued to persecute his family in Haiti. His father filed a complaint against Groupe 72, but a warrant was issued against his father for defamation. His father then filed a report against the judge. In Brazil, the male appellant was assaulted and threatened by criminals for refusing to join their group. In 2016, because of the violence and prejudice against Haitians, the appellants and their children left Brazil, travelling through several countries in order to reach the United States (US). In January 2017, as a result of the Trump administration\u2019s anti-immigration policy, they left the US for Canada, where they filed their refugee protection claims. On February 7, 2020, the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) rejected the appellants\u2019 refugee protection claims on the grounds that they are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. The determinative issue for the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) is exclusion under Article 1E. DETERMINATION I dismiss the appeal. The RPD was correct in determining that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection. ANALYSIS My role is to review all the evidence and to determine whether the RPD\u2019s decision is correct. The appellants argue that the RPD incorrectly applied the Zeng test. The appellants maintain that the evidence submitted to the RPD establishes that they did not have substantially the same rights as Brazilian nationals and therefore, section 98 should not apply and they should not be excluded. They submit that the RPD did not correctly consider and analyze the alleged violent events and discrimination as valid reasons for leaving Brazil for more than two years. The appellants submit that the RPD erred in transferring the burden of proof to them. The appellants argue that the RPD also failed to consider the risk they would be subjected to if they returned to Haiti. I do not agree with these allegations. The RPD concluded that Article 1E of the Convention applies to the appellants. In order to analyze whether the exclusion clause applies, the RPD correctly relied on Zeng, which sets out the following test for exclusion under Article 1E of the Convention. Considering all relevant factors to the date of the hearing, does the claimant have status, substantially similar to that of its nationals, in the third country? If the answer is yes, the claimant is excluded. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the claimant previously had such status and lost it, or had access to such status and failed to acquire it. If the answer is no, the claimant is not excluded under Article 1E. If the answer is yes, the RPD must consider and balance various factors. These include, but are not limited to, the reason for the loss of status (voluntary or involuntary), whether the claimant could return to the third country, the risk the claimant would face in the home country, Canada\u2019s international obligations, and any other relevant facts. I am of the opinion that the RPD was correct in concluding that permanent resident status in Brazil confers the rights and obligations that are attached to nationality within the intended meaning of Article 1E of the Convention. Even assuming that the appellants have lost this status, I agree with the RPD that the appellants must still be excluded from protection under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (the Act). The RPD did not err in applying the factors to consider according to Zeng. The appellants also failed to establish that it is likely that they would be personally subjected to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. The rights and obligations conferred by permanent residence in Brazil The appellants are basing their argument that certain social services are not available to permanent residents in Brazil on their personal experience. This is false. The Brazilian constitution clearly states that permanent residents in Brazil have the same rights and obligations as Brazilian citizens, with the exception of the right to vote on such matters as health, education and access to the labour market. While this may not be consistent with what the appellants experienced on various occasions, the fact remains that these are rights they could have asserted. The appellants do not dispute that their status allows them to return to Brazil. The appellants are challenging the RPD\u2019s conclusion that they lost their status voluntarily. Appellants\u2019 fear in Brazil The appellants state that they fear returning to Brazil because of the racial discrimination and persecution or abuse they could be subjected to. According to the case law, persecution requires an affliction of repeated acts of cruelty or a particular course or period of systematic infliction of punishment. In order for discriminatory acts to constitute persecution, they must be \u201csufficiently serious and occur over such a long period of time that it can be said that the claimants\u2019 physical or moral integrity is threatened.\u201d During the hearing, the appellants testified that when they lived in Brazil, Haitians were treated like pariahs. The male appellant testified that where they were living, they were not allowed to approach a Brazilian. As an example, he described an incident when he and his wife and children were walking down the street and a little Brazilian girl said hello to them. The little girl\u2019s mother allegedly told her not to play with this group of dogs. The male appellant also stated that he earned far less than a Brazilian woman who was doing the same job as him. The fact that the principal appellant earned a lower salary stems from several factors, especially considering the economic slump in Brazil in 2016, and cannot be characterized as persecution. I note that the appellants had living accommodations. The male appellant stated that there is systemic discrimination against Haitians at all levels. He testified that the texture of their hair and their accents gave them away and that they were discriminated against. I am of the opinion that the racist insults and abuse the male appellant was subjected to at work, while unfortunate, do not amount to persecution. In his Basis of Claim Form (BOC Form), the male appellant states that he left Brazil on December 16, 2016, because criminals living in his area had asked him on several occasions to join their group. I note that the RPD asked the male appellant to explain why the criminals wanted to recruit him, and he replied that it was because Haitians in Brazil are considered vulnerable, and because we\u2019re vulnerable, we\u2019re at everyone\u2019s mercy. Although the male appellant testified that he was recruited because he was vulnerable, the evidence on the record does not support the conclusion that this was because he is Haitian. On a balance of probabilities, this could have happened to any vulnerable person, regardless of their origin or nationality. This is therefore not persecution. The male appellant testified that the female appellant did not have full access to health services and received inadequate care when she had complications with one of her pregnancies. He stated that Brazilians are entitled to a card that gives them access to free medication, but not Haitians. The female appellant gave birth to their child at home and the umbilical cord was still attached. He stated that he called an ambulance, but in vain. He testified that he could not find a taxi as he was refused because of his Haitian accent. A Haitian with a small car drove the female appellant to the hospital. The RPD asked him whether he had filed a complaint, and he replied that he had not because even if he had, it would not have been considered. In such a situation, I would have expected the male appellant to take measures by contacting the authorities to obtain help, which he did not do. In addition, his failure to take these steps is not consistent with a fear for the lives of his wife and child, and this undermines his credibility. In addition, I note that the RPD asked him whether they had gone to the hospital and whether they had been treated by a doctor, and the male appellant testified that they had, but that they had waited for some time, which is why the child is sick so often now. The RPD also asked the female appellant whether she had filed a complaint against the doctor, but she answered that she had not because she knew that she would not obtain justice. The evidence on the record shows that the female appellant had access to health services at the time her child was born, as well as afterwards when her child received follow-up treatment. While the documentary evidence shows that the health system has two tiers, private and public, the evidence does not show that there is a different system for Haitians with permanent resident status. This is therefore not persecution. In addition, the male appellant testified that although they are Brazilian, their children do not have health cards. When the RPD asked why the children did not have health cards, given that they are Brazilian nationals, he replied that although they are Brazilian, they do not have the same rights as Brazilians because they are of Haitian origin and are black. I am of the opinion that as Brazilian nationals, the children have the same rights as other Brazilian citizens. In sum, the evidence on the record does not support the conclusion that the appellants were persecuted or that they face a serious possibility of persecution in Brazil. Having permanent resident status requires some effort to maintain its validity. As long as it is valid, the resident is demonstrating a continued interest in living in the host country permanently. The result of leaving the country for longer than a specified period, without a justification that is recognized under the law, is forfeiture of the right conferred by Brazil. Having obtained permanent resident status, the male and female appellants could have retained it and, if it became impossible for them to avail themselves of that status because they were outside of the country, it was their own actions that jeopardized their status. Considering that their reasons for leaving Brazil do not amount to persecution, I agree with the RPD that the male appellant and the associate appellant left Brazil voluntarily and chose to remain outside the country for more than two years. The loss of their permanent resident status was therefore voluntary and weighs in favour of exclusion. The RPD did not err. Possibility of returning to Brazil The appellants do not contest the RPD\u2019s interpretation of the Brazilian legal provisions concerning the family reunification program. In my opinion, it is accurate to say that the adult appellants could qualify for a visa allowing them to return to live in Brazil, given that their children have Brazilian citizenship. This factor therefore weighs in favour of exclusion. Canada\u2019s international obligations Concerning the possibility that they would be subjected to discrimination, it is important to note that Canada has never made a commitment to the international community to refuse to return refugee protection claimants on this specific ground. I believe that Canada\u2019s international obligations would be upheld if the exclusion under Article 1E of the Convention were applied, in particular, the obligation to protect individuals who have a well\u2011founded fear of persecution and individuals who would be subjected to a risk within the meaning of subsection 97(1) if they were to return to their country of origin. Failure to assess the risk in the country of origin In my opinion, in order to properly weigh the factors in Zeng, the RPD must have assessed the risk the male appellant would allegedly face in Haiti. Therefore, I assume that the allegations of risk in Haiti are credible, which weighs against exclusion. Assessment of the risk the appellants would face if they were returned to Brazil Before I can conclude that the male appellant is excluded from protection under the Act, I must consider whether he would face a serious possibility of persecution on one of the five grounds set out in section 96 of the Act (race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion). This question is also relevant to consider in the case of the associate appellant. None of the appellants have invoked a risk based on section 97 of the Act, that is, the likelihood that they would be personally subjected to a risk to their lives, to a danger of torture, or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. I will therefore not make a determination on that point. I do not consider that the RPD erred in assessing the risk of persecution. I will not deny that there is a serious possibility that the appellants could face discrimination at some point in time. However, in order for discrimination to be considered persecution, it must be sustained or affect basic human rights. The experiences of the male appellant and associate appellant in Brazil are not sufficient to represent a serious possibility that the level of discrimination to which they would be subjected in the future is serious enough to amount to persecution. After weighing all the factors in Zeng, although the risk in Haiti weighs against exclusion, the appellants lost their status voluntarily and can return to Brazil. In addition, they would not face a serious possibility of persecution by reason of their race or nationality should they return to Brazil. Under the circumstances, Canada is not violating its international obligations by excluding the appellants from the protection of the Act. The RAD has weighed all the factors in Zeng and they weigh in favour of excluding the male appellant under Article 1E of the Convention. Consequently, the male appellant and the associate appellant are persons described in Article 1E and are excluded from protection in Canada. The minor children The minor children are Brazilian citizens. The principal appellant, as their designated representative, did not present evidence or testimony that the minor children would fear persecution or would personally be subjected to a danger of torture, to a risk to their lives or to a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment in Brazil. In this case, after reviewing all the evidence, the RPD decision and the recording of the hearing, and having considered the arguments presented on appeal, I conclude that the decision to reject the refugee protection claim was correct. CONCLUSION I dismiss the appeal and confirm the RPD\u2019s determination that the appellants are neither Convention refugees nor persons in need of protection.
